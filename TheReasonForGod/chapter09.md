CONSERVATIVE writers and speakers are constantly complaining that the young people of our culture are relativistic and amoral. As a pastor in Manhattan I have been neck-deep in sophisticated
twentysomethings for almost two decades, and I have not found this to be the case. The secular, young adults I have known have a very finely honed sense of right and wrong. There are many things happening in
the world that evoke their moral outrage. There is a problem with their moral outlook, however.

## Free-Floating Morality
In many cases I have to put on my philosophy-professor hat in order to be a good pastor to people. A young couple once came to me for some spiritual direction. They "didn't believe in much of anything" they said.
How could they begin to figure out if there even was a God? I asked them to tell me about something they felt was really, really wrong. The woman immediately spoke out against practices that marginalized women.
I said I agreed with her fully since I was a Christian who believed God made all human beings, but I was curious why she thought it was wrong. She responded, “Women are human beings and human beings have
rights. It is wrong to trample on someone's rights." I asked her how she knew that.

Puzzled, she said, “Everyone knows it is wrong to violate the rights of someone." I said, "Most people in the world don't 'know' that. They don't have a Western view of human rights. Imagine if someone said to
you 'everyone knows that women are inferior.' You'd say, 'That's not an argument, it's just an assertion.' And you'd be right. So let's start again. If there is no God as you believe and everyone has just evolved from
animals, why would it be wrong to trample on someone's rights?" Her husband responded: "Yes, it is true we are just bigger-brained animals, but I'd say animals have rights too. You shouldn't trample on their rights,
either." I asked whether he held animals guilty for violating the rights of other animals if the stronger ones ate the weaker ones. "No, I couldn't do that." So he only held human beings guilty if they trampled on the
weak? "Yes." Why this double standard, I asked. Why did the couple insist that human beings had to be different from animals, so that they were not allowed to act as was natural to the rest of the animal world.

Why did the couple keep insisting that humans had this great, unique individual dignity and worth? Why did they believe in human rights? "I don't know," the woman said, "I guess they are just there, that's all."
The conversation was much more congenial than this very compressed account conveys. The young couple laughed at the weakness of some of their responses, which showed me that they were open to
exploration and that encouraged me to be more pointed than I would ordinarily have been. However, this conversation reveals how our culture differs from all the others that have gone before. People still have
strong moral convictions, but unlike people in other times and places, they don't have any visible basis for why they find some things to be evil and other things good. It's almost like their moral intuitions are free-
floating in midair-far off the ground.

Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz spoke of this:
> What has been surprising in the post-Cold War period are those beautiful and deeply moving words pronounced with veneration in places like Prague and Warsaw, words which pertain to the old
repertory of the rights of man and the dignity of the person. I wonder at this phenomenon because maybe underneath there is an abyss. After all, those ideas had their foundation in religion, and I am
not over-optimistic about the survival of religion in a scientific-technological civilization. Notions that seemed buried forever have suddenly been resurrected. But how long can they stay afloat if the
bottom is taken out?1

I don't believe Milosz is right. I think that people will definitely go on holding to their beliefs in human dignity even when conscious belief in God is gone. Why is this the case? I have a radical thesis. I think people
in our culture know unavoidably that there is a God, but they are repressing what they know.

## The Concept of Moral Obligation
It is common to hear people say, "No one should impose their moral views on others, because everyone has the right to find truth inside him or herself.” This belief leaves the speaker open to a series of very
uncomfortable questions. Aren't there people in the world who are doing things you believe are wrong things that they should stop doing no matter what they personally believe about the correctness of their
behavior? If you do (and everyone does!), doesn't that mean you do believe that there is some kind of moral standard that people should abide by regardless of their individual convictions? This raises a question.
Why is it impossible (in practice) for anyone to be a consistent moral relativist even when they claim that they are? The answer is that we all have a pervasive, powerful, and unavoidable belief not only in moral
values but also in moral obligation. Sociologist Christian Smith puts it like this:
> "Moral"...is an orientation toward understandings about what is right and wrong, just and unjust, that are not established by our own actual desires or preferences but instead are believed to exist apart
from them, providing standards by which our desires and preferences can themselves be judged.2

All human beings have moral feelings. We call it a conscience. When considering doing something that we feel would be wrong, we tend to refrain. Our moral sense does not stop there, however. We also believe
that there are standards "that exist apart from us” by which we evaluate moral feelings. Moral obligation is a belief that some things ought not to be done regardless of how a person feels about them within herself,
regardless of what the rest of her community and culture says, and regardless of whether it is in her self-interest or not. The young couple had no doubts that people in other cultures should honor women's rights,
for example.

Though we have been taught that all moral values are relative to individuals and cultures, we can't live like that. In actual practice we inevitably treat some principles as absolute standards by which we judge
the behavior of those who don't share our values. What gives us the right to do that, if all moral beliefs are relative? Nothing gives us the right. Yet we can't stop it. People who laugh at the claim that there is a
transcendent moral order do not think that racial genocide is just impractical or self-defeating, but that it is wrong. The Nazis who exterminated Jews may have claimed that they didn't feel it was immoral at all.
We don't care. We don't care if they sincerely felt they were doing a service to humanity. They ought not to have done it.

We do not only have moral feelings, but we also have an ineradicable belief that moral standards exist, outside of us, by which our internal moral feelings are evaluated. Why? Why do we think those moral
standards exist?

## The Evolutionary Theory of Moral Obligation
A common answer today comes from what I called in the last chapter the “clue-killer," sociobiology or evolutionary psychology. This view holds that altruistic people, those who act unselfishly and cooperatively,
survived in greater numbers than those who were selfish and cruel. Therefore altruistic genes were passed down to us and now the great majority of us feel that unselfish behavior is "right."

There are, however, many flaws in this theory, and it has been given some devastating critiques.2 An individual's self-sacrificing, altruistic behavior toward his or her blood kin might result in a greater survival
rate for the individual's family or extended clan, and therefore result in a greater number of descendants with that person's genetic material. For evolutionary purposes, however, the opposite response-hostility
to all people outside one's group-should be just as widely considered moral and right behavior. Yet today we believe that sacrificing time, money, emotion, and even life-especially for someone "not of our kind"
or tribe is right. If we see a total stranger fall in the river we jump in after him, or feel guilty for not doing so. In fact, most people will feel the obligation to do so even if the person in the water is an enemy. How
could that trait have come down by a process of natural selection? Such people would have been less likely to survive and pass on their genes. On the basis of strict evolutionary naturalism (the belief that everything
about us is here because of a process of natural selection) that kind of altruism should have died out of the human race long ago. Instead, it is stronger than ever.

Other arguments to demonstrate the reproductive benefits of altruism have also run into trouble. Some contend that altruistic behavior brings many indirect reciprocal benefits to the practitioner from others,
but this can't account for our motivation to practice such acts when no one knows about them. Others have contended that sacrificial behavior benefits an entire group or society, enabling the entire society to pass
on its genetic code. However, there is consensus that natural selection does not work on whole populations.4

Evolution, therefore, cannot account for the origin of our moral feelings, let alone for the fact that we all believe there are external moral standards by which moral feelings are evaluated.

## The Problem of Moral Obligation
This sense of moral obligation creates a problem for those with a secular understanding of the world. Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban is an anthropologist whose professional field is dominated by what she calls "cultural
relativism" a view that all moral beliefs are culturally created (that is, we believe them because we are part of a community that gives them plausibility) and that there is no basis for objectively judging one
culture's morality to be better than another. Yet she was appalled by practices in societies she was studying that oppressed women. She decided that she should promote women's interests in the societies wherever
she worked as an anthropologist.

This immediately created a conundrum for her. She knew that her belief in women's equality was rooted in a socially located (Northern European, eighteenth century) individualistic mode of thought. What
right did she have to promote her views over those of the non-Western societies where she worked? Her response:
> Anthropologists continue to express strong support for cultural relativism. One of the most contentious issues arises from the fundamental question: What authority do we Westerners have to impose
our own concept of universal rights on the rest of humanity.... [But] the cultural relativists' argument is often used by repressive governments to deflect international criticism of their abuse of their
citizens.... I believe that we should not let the concept of relativism stop us from using national and international forums to examine ways to protect the lives and dignity of people in every culture....

When there is a choice between defending human rights and defending cultural relativism, anthropologists should choose to protect and promote human rights. We cannot just be bystanders.

The author poses a difficult question: “If all cultures are relative, then so is the idea of universal human rights, so how can I decide to impose my values on this culture?" But she doesn't answer her own question.
She has just said that her charge of oppression is based on a Western concept of individual freedom, but she has no answer for this conundrum. She simply declares that women are being oppressed and she feels
she has to stop it. We have to bring our Western values to these other nations. Our values are better than theirs. Period.

The Difficult Issue of Human Rights
Fluehr-Lobban is struggling with a major crisis in the field of human rights. Jürgen Habermas has written that, despite their European origins, “human rights” in Asia, Africa, and South America now "constitute the
only language in which the opponents and victims of murderous regimes and civil wars can raise their voices against violence, repression, and persecution.”7 This reveals the enormous importance of the morality
of human rights, which Michael J. Perry defines as the twofold conviction that every human being has inherent dignity and that it is obligatory that we order our lives in accordance with this fact. It is wrong to
violate the equal dignity of other human beings. But why should we believe that? On what does this dignity depend?
In his essay "Where Do Rights Come From?"2 Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz lays out the possibilities. Some say human rights come from God. If we were all created in God's image, then every human
being would be sacred and inviolable. Dershowitz rejects this as an answer, since so many millions of people are agnostic. Others say human rights come from nature, or what has been called "natural law." They
argue that nature and human nature, if it is examined, will reveal that some kinds of behavior are "fitting" with the way things are, and are right. However, Dershowitz points out that nature thrives on violence
and predation, on the survival of the fittest. There is no way to derive the concept of the dignity of every individual from the way things really work in nature.
Another theory claims that human rights are created by us, the people who write the laws. Many argue that it is in the interests of societies to create human rights because honoring individual dignity means
that in the long run everyone in the community is better off. However, what if a majority decides it is not in their interest to grant human rights? If rights are nothing but a majority creation then there is nothing
to appeal to when they are legislated out of existence. Dershowitz, quoting Ronald Dworkin, argues that this third view of human rights is inadequate:
It is no answer to say that if individuals have these rights then the community is better off in the long run...because when we say someone has a right to speak his mind freely, we mean he is entitled to
do so even if this would not be in the general interest.
If human rights are created by majorities, of what use are they? Their value lies in that they can be used to insist that majorities honor the dignity of minorities and individuals despite their conception of their
"greater good." Rights cannot be created-they must be discovered, or they are of no value. As Dworkin concludes, if we want to defend individual rights, we must try to discover something beyond utility that argues
for these rights.10
What could that "something" be? Neither Dworkin nor Dershowitz can really give an answer. Dworkin ends up appealing to a form of majority rule anyway. In Life's Dominion: An Argument About Abortion,
Euthanasia, and Individual Freedom (1995), he writes:
The life of a single human organism commands respect and protection...because of our wonder at the...processes that produce new lives from old ones.... The nerve of the sacred lies in the value we attach
to a process or enterprise or project rather than to its results considered independently from how they were produced....
Law professor Michael J. Perry responds:
The nonreligious source of normativity, for Dworkin, is the great value "we" attach to every human being understood as a creative masterpiece; it is "our" wonder at the processes that produce new lives
from old ones..... But to whom is Dworkin referring with his "we" and "our"? Did the Nazis value the Jews intrinsically? The conspicuous problem with Dworkin's...secular argument [for rights] is that
Dworkin assumes a consensus among human agents that does not exist and never has existed.12
Perry's new book, Toward a Theory of Human Rights, is very significant. Perry concludes that though it is clear “there is a religious ground for the morality of human rights... It is far from clear that there is a non-
religious ground,13 a secular ground, for human rights."14 Perry lays out Nietzsche's well-known insistence that, if God is dead, any and all morality of love and human rights is baseless. If there is no God, argues
Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, there can be no good reason to be kind, to be loving, or to work for peace. Perry quotes Philippa Foot who says that secular thinkers accepted the idea that there is no God and no given
meaning to human life, but have not "really joined battle with Nietzsche about morality. By and large we have just gone on taking moral judgments for granted as if nothing had happened."15 Why do we keep on
doing this?
The Grand "Sez Who?"
The reason is laid out in a classic essay by late Yale law professor Arthur Leff. Most people feel that human rights are not created by us but are found by us, that they are there and must be honored by majorities,
whether they like them or not. But, Leff says:
> When would it be impermissible to make the formal intellectual equivalent of what is known in barrooms and schoolyards as "the grand Sez Who"? In the absence of God...each...ethical and legal
system...will be differentiated by the answer it chooses to give to one key question: who among us... ought to be able to declare “law” that ought to be obeyed? Stated that baldly, the question is so
intellectually unsettling that one would expect to find a noticeable number of legal and ethical thinkers trying not to come to grips with it.... Either God exists or He does not, but if He does not, nothing
and no one else can take His place....16
If there is no God, then there is no way to say any one action is "moral" and another "immoral" but only "I like this." If that is the case, who gets the right to put their subjective, arbitrary moral feelings into law?
You may say "the majority has the right to make the law," but do you mean that then the majority has the right to vote to exterminate a minority? If you say "No, that is wrong," then you are back to square one.
"Who sez❞ that the majority has a moral obligation not to kill the minority? Why should your moral convictions be obligatory for those in opposition? Why should your view prevail over the will of the majority?
The fact is, says Leff, if there is no God, then all moral statements are arbitrary, all moral valuations are subjective and internal, and there can be no external moral standard by which a person's feelings and values
are judged. Yet Leff ends this intellectual essay in a most shocking way:
As things are now, everything is up for grabs. Nevertheless: napalming babies is bad. Starving the poor is wicked. Buying and selling each other is depraved.... There is such a thing as evil. All together
now: Sez Who? God help us.
Nietzsche, of course, understood this. "The masses blink and say: 'We are all equal—Man is but man, before God we are all equal.' Before God! But now this God has died.”17 Raimond Gaita, an atheist thinker,
reluctantly writes:
Only someone who is religious can speak seriously of the sacred.... We may say that all human beings are inestimably precious, that they are ends in themselves, that they are owed unconditional
respect, that they possess inalienable rights, and, of course, that they possess inalienable dignity. In my judgment these are ways of trying to say what we feel a need to say when we are estranged from
the conceptual resources [i.e. God] we need to say it.... Not one of [these statements about human beings] has the power of the religious way of speaking...that we are sacred because God loves us, his
children.18
Leff is not simply concluding that there is no basis for human rights without God. He is also pointing out (as are Dershowitz and Dworkin, in their own way) that despite the fact that we can't justify or ground
human rights in a world without God, we still know they exist. Leff is not just speaking generically, but personally. Without God he can't justify moral obligation, and yet he can't not know it exists.
The Argument for God from the Violence of Nature
Why would we know this? To sharpen our focus on the significance of this indelible knowledge of moral obligation, consider the observations of writer Annie Dillard. Dillard lived for a year by a creek in the
mountains of Virginia expecting to be inspired and refreshed by closeness to "nature." Instead, she came to realize that nature was completely ruled by one central principle-violence by the strong against the
weak.
There is not a person in the world that behaves as badly as praying mantises. But wait, you say, there is no right or wrong in nature; right and wrong is a human concept! Precisely! We are moral creatures
in an amoral world.... Or consider the alternative...it is only human feeling that is freakishly amiss.... All right then-it is our emotions that are amiss. We are freaks, the world is fine, and let us all go
have lobotomies to restore us to a natural state. We can leave...lobotomized, go back to the creek, and live on its banks as untroubled as any muskrat or reed. You first.12

Annie Dillard saw that all of nature is based on violence. Yet we inescapably believe it is wrong for stronger human individuals or groups to kill weaker ones. If violence is totally natural why would it be wrong for
strong humans to trample weak ones? There is no basis for moral obligation unless we argue that nature is in some part unnatural. We can't know that nature is broken in some way unless there is some supernatural
standard of normalcy apart from nature by which we can judge right and wrong. That means there would have to be heaven or God or some kind of divine order outside of nature in order to make that judgment.
There is only one way out of this conundrum. We can pick up the Biblical account of things and see if it explains our moral sense any better than a secular view. If the world was made by a God of peace, justice,
and love, then that is why we know that violence, oppression, and hate are wrong. If the world is fallen, broken, and needs to be redeemed, that explains the violence and disorder we see.

If you believe human rights are a reality, then it makes much more sense that God exists than that he does not. If you insist on a secular view of the world and yet you continue to pronounce some things right
and some things wrong, then I hope you see the deep disharmony between the world your intellect has devised and the real world (and God) that your heart knows exists. This leads us to a crucial question. If a
premise ("There is no God") leads to a conclusion you know isn't true ("Napalming babies is culturally relative") then why not change the premise?
The Endless, Pointless Litigation of Existence
I have not tried to prove the existence of God to you. My goal has been to show you that you already know God is there. To some degree I have been treating the nonexistence of God as an intellectual problem, but
it is much more than that. It not only makes all moral choices meaningless, but it makes all life meaningless too. The playwright Arthur Miller reveals this vividly through the character Quentin in After the Fall.
Quentin says:
For many years I looked at life like a case at law. It was a series of proofs. When you're young you prove how brave you are, or smart; then, what a good lover; then, a good father; finally, how wise, or
powerful or [whatever.] But underlying it all, I see now, there was a presumption. That one moved...on an upward path toward some elevation, where...God knows what...I would be justified, or even
condemned. A verdict anyway. I think now that my disaster really began when I looked up one day...and the bench was empty. No judge in sight. And all that remained was the endless argument with
oneself, this pointless litigation of existence before an empty bench.... Which, of course, is another way of saying—despair.20
What is he saying? We all live as if it is better to seek peace instead of war, to tell the truth instead of lying, to care and nurture rather than to destroy. We believe that these choices are not pointless, that it matters
which way we choose to live. Yet if the Cosmic Bench is truly empty, then "who sez❞ that one choice is better than the others? We can argue about it, but it's just pointless arguing, endless litigation. If the Bench is
truly empty, then the whole span of human civilization, even if it lasts a few million years, will be just an infinitesimally brief spark in relation to the oceans of dead time that preceded it and will follow it. There
will be no one around to remember any of it. Whether we are loving or cruel in the end would make no difference at all.21
Once we realize this situation there are two options. One is that we can simply refuse to think out the implications of all this. We can hold on to our intellectual belief in an empty Bench and yet live as if our
choices are meaningful and as if there is a difference between love and cruelty. Why would we do that? A cynic might say that this is a way of "having one's cake and eating it, too." That is, you get the benefit of
having a God without the cost of following him. But there is no integrity in that.
The other option is to recognize that you do know there is a God. You could accept the fact that you live as if beauty and love have meaning, as if there is meaning in life, as if human beings have inherent dignity
-all because you know God exists. It is dishonest to live as if he is there and yet fail to acknowledge the one who has given you all these gifts.
