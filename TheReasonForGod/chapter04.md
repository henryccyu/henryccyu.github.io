# FOUR THE CHURCH Is Responsible FOR SO MUCH INJUSTICE
"I have to doubt any religion that has so many fanatics and hypocrites," insisted Helen, a law student. "There are so many people who are not religious at all who are more kind and even more moral
than many of the Christians I know."

"The church has a history of supporting injustice, of destroying culture," responded Jessica, another law student. "If Christianity is the true religion, how could this be?"
MARK Lilla, a professor at the University of Chicago, wrote an account for The New York Times Magazine of his "born again" experience as a teenager. During college he "de-converted" and abandoned his Christian
faith. How did it happen? Moving from Detroit to Ann Arbor, Michigan, he entered a Christian community that had a national reputation for spiritual vitality, but it turned out to be a "crushing disappointment."
The community was authoritarian and hierarchical, and the members were "dogmatic...eager to bring me into line doctrinally." Disillusioned by the combative and exploitative way he thought they used the Bible
to control people's lives, "the thought penetrated my mind that the Bible might be wrong.... It was my first step out of the world of faith..."1

Many people who take an intellectual stand against Christianity do so against a background of personal disappointment with Christians and churches. We all bring to issues intellectual predispositions based
on our experiences. If you have known many wise, loving, kind, and insightful Christians over the years, and if you have seen churches that are devout in belief yet civic-minded and generous, you will find the
intellectual case for Christianity much more plausible. If, on the other hand, the preponderance of your experience is with nominal Christians (who bear the name but don't practice it) or with self-righteous
fanatics, then the arguments for Christianity will have to be extremely strong for you to concede that they have any cogency at all. Mark Lilla's determination that "the Bible might be wrong" was not a pure act of
philosophical reflection. He was resisting the way that a particular person, in the name of Christianity, was trying to exercise power over him.

So we have to address the behavior of Christians-individual and corporate that has undermined the plausibility of Christianity for so many people. Three issues stand out. First, there is the issue of
Christians' glaring character flaws. If Christianity is the truth, why are so many non-Christians living better lives than the Christians? Second, there is the issue of war and violence. If Christianity is the truth, why
has the institutional church supported war, injustice, and violence over the years? Third, there is the issue of fanaticism. Even if Christian teaching has much to offer, why would we want to be together with so
many smug, self-righteous, dangerous fanatics?

Character Flaws

Anyone involved in the life of a church will soon discover the many flaws in the character of the average professing Christian. Church communities seem, if anything, to be characterized by more fighting and
party spirit than do other voluntary organizations. Also, the moral failings of Christian leaders are well known. It may be true that the press takes too much pleasure in publicizing them, but it doesn't create them.
Church officials seem to be at least (if not more) corrupt than leaders in the world at large.

At the same time there are many formally irreligious people who live morally exemplary lives. If Christianity is all it claims to be, shouldn't Christians on the whole be much better people than everyone else?
This assumption is based on a mistaken belief concerning what Christianity actually teaches about itself. Christian theology has taught what is known as common grace. James 1:17 says, "Every good and
perfect gift comes down from above...from the father of lights." This means that no matter who performs it, every act of goodness, wisdom, justice, and beauty is empowered by God. God gives out good gifts of
wisdom, talent, beauty, and skill "graciously"—that is, in a completely unmerited way. He casts them across all humanity, regardless of religious conviction, race, gender, or any other attribute to enrich, brighten,
and preserve the world.

Christian theology also speaks of the seriously flawed character of real Christians. A central message of the Bible is that we can only have a relationship with God by sheer grace. Our moral efforts are too
feeble and falsely motivated to ever merit salvation. Jesus, through his death and resurrection, has provided salvation for us, which we receive as a gift. All churches believe this in one form or another. Growth
in character and changes in behavior occur in a gradual process after a person becomes a Christian. The mistaken belief that a person must "clean up" his or her own life in order to merit God's presence is not
Christianity. This means, though, that the church will be filled with immature and broken people who still have a long way to go emotionally, morally, and spiritually. As the saying has it: "The church is a hospital
for sinners, not a museum for saints."

Good character is largely attributable to a loving, safe, and stable family and social environment-conditions for which we were not responsible. Many have had instead an unstable family background, poor
role models, and a history of tragedy and disappointment. As a result, they are burdened with deep insecurities, hypersensitivity, and a lack of self-confidence. They may struggle with uncontrolled anger, shyness,
addictions, and other difficulties as a result.

Now imagine that someone with a very broken past becomes a Christian and her character improves significantly over what it was. Nevertheless, she still may be less secure and self-disciplined than someone
who is so well adjusted that she feels no particular need for religious affiliation at all. Suppose you meet both of these women the same week. Unless you know the starting points and life journeys of each woman,
you could easily conclude that Christianity isn't worth much, and that Christians are inconsistent with their own high standards. It is often the case that people whose lives have been harder and who are "lower
on the character scale" are more likely to recognize their need for God and turn to Christianity. So we should expect that many Christians' lives would not compare well to those of the nonreligious² (just as the
health of people in the hospital is comparatively worse than people visiting museums).

Doesn't orthodox religion lead inevitably to violence? Christopher Hitchens, the author of God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, argues that it does. In his chapter "Religion Kills," he gives personal
accounts of religion-fueled violence in Belfast, Beirut, Bombay, Belgrade, Bethlehem, and Baghdad. His argument is that religion takes racial and cultural differences and aggravates them. "Religion is not unlike
racism," he writes. "One version of it inspires and provokes the other. Religion has been an enormous multiplier of tribal suspicion and hatred...."

Hitchens's point is fair. Religion "transcendentalizes" ordinary cultural differences so that parties feel they are in a cosmic battle between good and evil. This is why Hitchens argues that "religion poisons
everything." So it would seem. Christian nations institutionalized imperialism, violence, and oppression through the Inquisition and the African slave trade. The totalitarian and militaristic Japanese empire of
the mid-twentieth century grew out of a culture deeply influenced by Buddhism and Shintoism. Islam is the soil for much of today's terrorism, while Israeli forces have often been ruthless too. Hindu nationalists,
in the name of their religion, carry out bloody strikes on both Christian churches and Muslim mosques. All of this evidence seems to indicate that religion aggravates human differences until they boil over into
war, violence, and the oppression of minorities.4

There are problems with this view, however. The Communist Russian, Chinese, and Cambodian regimes of the twentieth century rejected all organized religion and belief in God. A forerunner of all these
was the French Revolution, which rejected traditional religion for human reason. These societies were all rational and secular, yet each produced massive violence against its own people without the influence of
religion. Why? Alister McGrath points out that when the idea of God is gone, a society will "transcendentalize" something else, some other concept, in order to appear morally and spiritually superior. The Marxists
made the State into such an absolute, while the Nazis did it to race and blood. Even the ideals of liberty and equality can be used in this way in order to do violence to opponents. In 1793, when Madame Roland
went to the guillotine on trumped-up charges, she bowed to the statue personifying liberty in the Place de la Révolution and said, "Liberty, what crimes are committed in your name."5
Violence done in the name of Christianity is a terrible reality and must be both addressed and redressed. There is no excusing it. In the twentieth century, however, violence has been inspired as much by
secularism as by moral absolutism. Societies that have rid themselves of all religion have been just as oppressive as those steeped in it. We can only conclude that there is some violent impulse so deeply rooted
in the human heart that it expresses itself regardless of what the beliefs of a particular society might be whether socialist or capitalist, whether religious or irreligious, whether individualistic or hierarchical.
Ultimately, then, the fact of violence and warfare in a society is no necessary refutation of the prevailing beliefs of that society.

Fanaticism

Perhaps the biggest deterrent to Christianity for the average person today is not so much violence and warfare but the shadow of fanaticism. Many nonbelievers have friends or relatives who have become
"born again" and seem to have gone off the deep end. They soon begin to express loudly their disapproval of various groups and sectors of our society-especially movies and television, the Democratic party,
homosexuals, evolutionists, activist judges, members of other religions, and the values taught in public schools. When arguing for the truth of their faith they often appear intolerant and self-righteous. This is
what many people would call fanaticism.

Many people try to understand Christians along a spectrum from "nominalism" at one end to "fanaticism" on the other. A nominal Christian is someone who is Christian in name only, who does not practice
it and perhaps barely believes it. A fanatic is someone who is thought to over-believe and over-practice Christianity. In this schematic, the best kind of Christian would be someone in the middle, someone who
doesn't go all the way with it, who believes it but is not too devoted to it. The problem with this approach is that it assumes that the Christian faith is basically a form of moral improvement. Intense Christians
would therefore be intense moralists or, as they were called in Jesus's time, Pharisees. Pharisaic people assume they are right with God because of their moral behavior and right doctrine. This leads naturally to
feelings of superiority toward those who do not share their religiosity, and from there to various forms of abuse, exclusion, and oppression. This is the essence of what we think of as fanaticism.
What if, however, the essence of Christianity is salvation by grace, salvation not because of what we do but because of what Christ has done for us? Belief that you are accepted by God by sheer grace is
profoundly humbling. The people who are fanatics, then, are so not because they are too committed to the gospel but because they're not committed to it enough.

Think of people you consider fanatical. They're overbearing, self-righteous, opinionated, insensitive, and harsh. Why? It's not because they are too Christian but because they are not Christian enough. They
are fanatically zealous and courageous, but they are not fanatically humble, sensitive, loving, empathetic, forgiving, or understanding—as Christ was. Because they think of Christianity as a self-improvement
program they emulate the Jesus of the whips in the temple, but not the Jesus who said, "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone" (John 8:7). What strikes us as overly fanatical is actually a failure to be fully
committed to Christ and his gospel.

The Biblical Critique of Religion

Extremism and fanaticism, which lead to injustice and oppression, are a constant danger within any body of religious believers. For Christians, however, the antidote is not to tone down and moderate their faith,
but rather to grasp a fuller and truer faith in Christ. The Biblical prophets understood this well. In fact, the scholar Merold Westphal documents how Marx's analysis of religion as an instrument of oppression was
anticipated by the Hebrew prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and even by the message of the New Testament gospels. Marx, according to Westphal, was unoriginal in his critique of religion-the Bible beat him to
it!

Jesus conducts a major critique of religion. His famous Sermon on the Mount (Matthew chapters 5, 6, and 7) does not criticize irreligious people, but rather religious ones. In his famous discourse the people he
criticizes pray, give to the poor, and seek to live according to the Bible, but they do so in order to get acclaim and power for themselves. They believe they will get leverage over others and even over God because of
their spiritual performance ("They think they will be heard for their many words"-Matthew 6:7). This makes them judgmental and condemning, quick to give criticism, and unwilling to take it. They are fanatics.
In his teaching, Jesus continually says to the respectable and upright, "The tax collectors and the prostitutes enter the kingdom before you" (Matthew 21:31). He continuously condemns in white-hot language
their legalism, self-righteousness, bigotry, and love of wealth and power ("You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.... You neglect justice and the love of God...You
load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.... [You] devour widows' houses and for a show make long prayers"-Luke 11:39-46; 20:47). We should
not be surprised to discover it was the Bible-believing religious establishment who put Jesus to death. As Swiss theologian Karl Barth put it, it was the church, not the world, who crucified Christ.Z
Jesus followed the lead of the Hebrew prophets such as Isaiah, who said to the people of his day:
> Day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They seem eager for God to
come near them. "Why have we fasted," they say, "and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?" Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please
and exploit all your workers.... Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice...to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? Is it not to share your food with the
hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter-when you see the naked, to clothe him...? (Isaiah 58:2-7)

What were the prophets and Jesus criticizing? They were not against prayer and fasting and obedience to Biblical directions for life. The tendency of religious people, however, is to use spiritual and ethical
observance as a lever to gain power over others and over God, appeasing him through ritual and good works. This leads to both an emphasis on external religious forms as well as greed, materialism, and
oppression in social arrangements. Those who believe they have pleased God by the quality of their devotion and moral goodness naturally feel that they and their group deserve deference and power over others.
The God of Jesus and the prophets, however, saves completely by grace. He cannot be manipulated by religious and moral performance he can only be reached through repentance, through the giving up of power.
If we are saved by sheer grace we can only become grateful, willing servants of God and of everyone around us. Jesus charged his disciples: Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, and whoever
wants to be first must be servant of all" (Mark 10:43-45).

In Jesus's and the prophets' critique, self-righteous religion is always marked by insensitivity to issues of social justice, while true faith is marked by profound concern for the poor and marginalized. The Swiss
theologian John Calvin, in his commentaries on the Hebrew prophets, says that God so identifies with the poor that their cries express divine pain. The Bible teaches us that our treatment of them equals our
treatment of God.

While the church has inexcusably been party to the oppression of people at times, it is important to realize that the Bible gives us tools for analysis and unflinching critique of religiously supported injustice
from within the faith. Historian C. John Sommerville claims that even strong secular critics of Christianity are really using resources from within it to denounce it.2 Many criticize the church for being power-
hungry and self-regarding, but there are many cultures in which the drive for power and respect is considered a good. Where, then, did we get this list of virtues by which we can discern the church's sins, asks
Sommerville? We actually got it from within the Christian faith.

To illustrate this point to his students, Sommerville invites them to do a thought experiment. He points out that the pre-Christian northern European tribes, like the Anglo-Saxons, had societies based on the
concept of honor. They were shame-based cultures in which earning and insisting upon respect from others was paramount. The Christian monks who were trying to convert them had a set of values based on
charity, on wanting the best for others. To see the difference he asks his students to imagine seeing a little old lady coming down the street at night carrying a big purse. Why not just knock her over and take the
purse and its money? The answer of an honor-shame culture is that you do not take her purse, because if you pick on the weak you would be a despicable person. No one would respect you and you would not
respect yourself. That ethic, of course, is self-regarding. You are focused on how the action will affect your honor and reputation. There is, however, another train of thought to take. You may imagine how much
it would hurt to be mugged, and how the loss of money might harm people who depend on her. So you don't take the money because you want the best for her and for her dependents. This is an other-regarding
ethic; you are thinking completely about her.

Over the years Sommerville found that the overwhelming majority of his students reasoned according to the second, other-regarding ethic. As a historian, he then showed them how Christian their moral
orientation was. Christianity changed those honor-based cultures in which pride was valued rather than humility, dominance rather than service, courage rather than peaceableness, glory rather than modesty,
loyalty to one's own tribe rather than equal respect for all.10

The typical criticisms by secular people about the oppressiveness and injustices of the Christian church actually come from Christianity's own resources for critique of itself. The shortcomings of the church
can be understood historically as the imperfect adoption and practice of the principles of the Christian gospel. Sommerville says that when the Anglo-Saxons first heard the Christian gospel message they were
incredulous. They couldn't see how any society could survive that did not fear and respect strength. When they did convert, they were far from consistent. They tended to merge the Christian other-regarding
ethic with their older ways. They supported the Crusades as a way of protecting God's honor and theirs. They let monks, women, and serfs cultivate charitable virtues, but these virtues weren't considered
appropriate for men of honor and action. No wonder there is so much to condemn in church history. But to give up Christian standards would be to leave us with no basis for the criticism.11
What is the answer, then, to the very fair and devastating criticisms of the record of the Christian church? The answer is not to abandon the Christian faith, because that would leave us with neither the
standards nor the resources to make correction. Instead we should move to a fuller and deeper grasp of what Christianity is. The Bible itself has taught us to expect the abuses of religion and it has also told us what
to do about them. Because of this, Christian history gives us many remarkable examples of self-correction. Let's look at perhaps the two leading examples of this.

Justice in Jesus's Name

A deep stain on Christian history is the African slave trade. Since Christianity was dominant in the nations that bought and sold slaves during that time, the churches must bear responsibility along with their
societies for what happened. Even though slavery in some form was virtually universal in every human culture over the centuries, it was Christians who first came to the conclusion that it was wrong. The social
historian Rodney Stark writes:
> Although it has been fashionable to deny it, anti-slavery doctrines began to appear in Christian theology soon after the decline of Rome and were accompanied by the eventual disappearance of slavery
in all but the fringes of Christian Europe. When Europeans subsequently instituted slavery in the New World, they did so over strenuous papal opposition, a fact that was conveniently "lost" from
history until recently. Finally, the abolition of New World slavery was initiated and achieved by Christian activists,12
Christians began to work for abolition not because of some general understanding of human rights, but because they saw it as violating the will of God. Older forms of indentured servanthood and the bond-
service of Biblical times had often been harsh, but Christian abolitionists concluded that race-based, life-long chattel slavery, established through kidnapping, could not be squared with Biblical teaching either
in the Old Testament or the New.13 Christian activists such as William Wilberforce in Great Britain, John Woolman in America, and many, many others devoted their entire lives, in the name of Christ, to ending
slavery. The slave trade was so tremendously lucrative that there was enormous incentive within the church to justify it. Many church leaders defended the institution. The battle for self-correction was titanic.14
When the abolitionists finally had British society poised to abolish slavery in their empire, planters in the colonies foretold that emancipation would cost investors enormous sums and the prices of
commodities would skyrocket catastrophically. This did not deter the Abolitionists in the House of Commons. They agreed to compensate the planters for all freed slaves, an astounding sum up to half of the
British government's annual budget. The Act of Emancipation passed in 1833, and the costs were so high to the British people that one historian called the British abolition of slavery "voluntary econocide."
Rodney Stark notes how historians have been desperately trying to figure out why the abolitionists were willing to sacrifice so much to end slavery. He quotes the historian Howard Temperley, who says that
the history of abolition is puzzling because most historians believe all political behavior is self-interested. Yet despite the fact that hundreds of scholars over the last fifty years have looked for ways to explain it,
Temperley says, "no one has succeeded in showing that those who campaigned for the end of the slave trade...stood to gain in any tangible way...or that these measures were other than economically costly to
the country." Slavery was abolished because it was wrong, and Christians were the leaders in saying so.15 Christianity's self-correcting apparatus, its critique of religiously supported acts of injustice, had asserted
itself.

Another classic case of this is the Civil Rights movement in the United States in the mid-twentieth century. In an important history of the movement, David L. Chappell demonstrates that it was not a political
but primarily a religious and spiritual movement. White Northern liberals who were the allies of the African-American civil rights leaders were not proponents of civil disobedience or of a direct attack on
segregation. Because of their secular belief in the goodness of human nature, they thought that education and enlightenment would bring about inevitable social and racial progress. Chappell argues that black
leaders were much more rooted in the Biblical understanding of the sinfulness of the human heart and in the denunciations of injustice that they read in the Hebrew prophets. Chappell also shows how it was the
vibrant faith of rank-and-file African-Americans that empowered them to insist on justice despite the violent opposition to their demands. Thus Chappell says there is no way to understand what happened until
you see the Civil Rights movement as a religious revival.16

When Martin Luther King, Jr., confronted racism in the white church in the South, he did not call on Southern churches to become more secular. Read his sermons and "Letter from Birmingham Jail" and see
how he argued. He invoked God's moral law and the Scripture. He called white Christians to be more true to their own beliefs and to realize what the Bible really teaches. He did not say "Truth is relative and everyone
is free to determine what is right or wrong for them." If everything is relative, there would have been no incentive for white people in the South to give up their power. Rather, Dr. King invoked the prophet Amos,
who said, "Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream" (Amos 5:24). The greatest champion of justice in our era knew the antidote to racism was not less Christianity, but a deeper and
truer Christianity.

Wilberforce and King were not by any means the only leaders who have turned the tide against injustice in the name of Christ. After apartheid was abolished in South Africa, everyone expected a bloodbath
in which former victims would take violent vengeance on their persecutors and former oppressors would defend themselves with force. Instead, Christian leaders like Desmond Tutu set up the remarkable South
African Commission for Truth and Reconciliation in the mid-1990s. Its name expressed its principle and mission. It invited victims to come forward to tell their stories publicly. It also invited former perpetrators
of oppression and violence to come forward, tell the truth, and ask for amnesty. No side was exempt from appearing before the commission. The commission heard reports of human rights violations and
considered amnesty applications from all sides, from the former apartheid state as well as from the African National Congress. Though not without its flaws and critics, the commission helped bring about the
transition of majority rule with far less bloodshed than anyone could have expected.

In the late twentieth century the Catholic church in eastern Europe refused to die under Communism. Through "patience, candles, and crosses" it began the chain of events that brought down all those
totalitarian regimes. The Polish priest Jerzy Popieluszko, through his preaching and activism, led the movement for a free trade union in Communist Poland in the early 1980s. When he was murdered by the secret
police, 250,000 people came to his funeral, including Lech Walesa, whose Solidarity movement would help bring down the Communist government. Many of those who went to his funeral marched past the secret
police headquarters with a banner that read "We Forgive.”17 The Christian underpinnings of the resistance movement were unmistakable.

There is a long list of martyrs who stood up for the oppressed in Jesus's name, such as Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador. Romero was made archbishop for his conservative, orthodox, doctrinal views. In
his new post he saw irrefutable evidence of chronic and violent human rights abuses by the government. He began to speak out fearlessly against it, and as a result he was shot to death in 1980 while saying Mass.
The famous Lutheran martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer was pastoring two German-speaking churches in London when Hitler came to power. He refused to stay at a safe distance and returned to his country to head
an illegal seminary for the Confessing Church, the Christian congregations that refused to sign an oath of allegiance to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer wrote the classic The Cost of Discipleship, in which he critiqued the
religion and church of his day. In echoes of Jesus and the prophets, Bonhoeffer revealed the spiritual deadness and self-satisfied complacency that made it possible for so many to cooperate with Hitler and turn a
blind eye to those being systematically marginalized and destroyed by the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was eventually arrested and hanged.

In his last letters from prison, Bonhoeffer reveals how his Christian faith gave him the resources to give up everything for the sake of others. Marx argued that if you believe in a life after this one you won't be
concerned about making this world a better place. You can also argue the opposite. If this world is all there is, and if the goods of this world are the only love, comfort, and wealth I will ever have, why should I
sacrifice them for others? Bonhoeffer, however, had a joy and hope in God that made it possible for him to do what he did:
> It is not a religious act that makes the Christian, but participation in the sufferings of God in the secular life. That is metanoia [repentance]: not in the first place thinking about one's own needs,
problems, sins, and fears, but allowing oneself to be caught up into the way of Jesus Christ.... Pain is a holy angel.... Through him men have become greater than through all the joys of the world.... The
pain of longing, which often can be felt physically, must be there, and we shall not and need not talk it away. But it needs to be overcome every time, and thus there is an even holier angel than the one
of pain, that is the one of joy in God. 18

Why mention all of these examples? They are evidence that Dr. King was right. When people have done injustice in the name of Christ they are not being true to the spirit of the one who himself died as a victim
of injustice and who called for the forgiveness of his enemies. When people give their lives to liberate others as Jesus did, they are realizing the true Christianity that Martin Luther King, Jr., Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
and other Christian voices have called for.
