THE PROBLEM OF SIN
Can we doubt that presently our race will more than realize our boldest imaginations, that it will achieve unity and peace, and that our children will live in a world made more splendid and lovely than
any palace or garden that we know, going on from strength to strength in an ever-widening circle of achievement? What man has done, the little triumphs of his present state...form but the prelude to
the things that man has yet to do.
-H. G. Wells, A Short History of the World (1937)
The cold-blooded massacres of the defenseless, the return of deliberate and organized torture, mental torment, and fear to a world from which such things had seemed well nigh banished-has come near
to breaking my spirit altogether..."Homo Sapiens," as he has been pleased to call himself, is played out.
-H. G. Wells, A Mind at the End of Its Tether (1946)
IT is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is something fundamentally wrong with the world. According to Christianity our biggest problem is sin. Yet the concept of "sin" is offensive or ludicrous to many. This
is often because we don't understand what Christians mean by the term.
Sin and Human Hope
Many have the impression that the Christian doctrine of sin is bleak and pessimistic about human nature. Nothing could be further from the truth. When I was brand-new in the ministry a young man came to
see me whose wife had just left him. He was feeling angry at what she had done, guilty over his own flaws that had led her to do it, and despondent before the whole situation. I said that what he needed more
than anything was hope. He quickly agreed and asked how he could get some. As gently as possible I said that the good news was he was a sinner. Because he was a sinner he wasn't simply the helpless victim of
psychological drives or social systems. Years later I came across a passage in a sermon by Barbara Brown Taylor, who said more eloquently what I tried to say that day.
Neither the language of medicine nor of law is adequate substitute for the language of [sin.] Contrary to the medical model, we are not entirely at the mercy of our maladies. The choice is to enter into
the process of repentance. Contrary to the legal model, the essence of sin is not [primarily] the violation of laws but a wrecked relationship with God, one another, and the whole created order. "All sins
are attempts to fill voids," wrote Simone Weil. Because we cannot stand the God-shaped hole inside of us, we try stuffing it full of all sorts of things, but only God may fill [it].1
Andrew Delbanco is a humanities professor at Columbia University. Some years ago he was doing research on Alcoholics Anonymous and was attending AA meetings around the country. One Saturday morning
in a New York City church basement he was listening to a "crisply dressed young man" who was talking about his problems. In his narrative he was absolutely faultless. All his mistakes were due to the injustice and
betrayals of others. He spoke of how he was going to avenge himself on all who had wronged him. "His every gesture gave the impression of grievously wounded pride," Delbanco wrote. It was clear that the young
man was trapped in his need to justify himself, and that things could only get worse and worse in his life until he recognized this. While he was speaking, a black man in his forties, in dreadlocks and dark shades,
leaned over to Delbanco and said, “I used to feel that way too, before I achieved low self-esteem.” Delbanco wrote later in his book, The Real American Dream: A Meditation on Hope:
This was more than a good line. For me it was the moment I understood in a new way the religion I had claimed to know something about. As the speaker bombarded us with phrases like "got to take
control of my life," and "I've got to really believe in myself" the man beside me took refuge in the old Calvinist doctrine that pride is the enemy of hope. What he meant by his joke about self-esteem was
that he learned no one can save himself by dint of his own efforts. He thought the speaker was still lost—lost in himself, but without knowing it.2

By "low self-esteem” the man in the dreadlocks did not mean the young man should come to hate himself. He meant that the well-dressed young man was "lost in himself" until he could admit he was a very
flawed human being, a sinner. He would never be liberated to see his own flaws in their true light, to forgive those who had wronged him, or to humbly seek and receive forgiveness from others. The Christian
doctrine of sin, properly understood, can be a great resource for human hope, but what is that doctrine?
The Meaning of Sin
The famous Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard wrote a fascinating little book called The Sickness Unto Death in 1849. In it he defined "sin" in a way that is rooted in the Bible but also is accessible to contemporary
people. "Sin is: in despair not wanting to be oneself before God.... Faith is: that the self in being itself and wanting to be itself is grounded transparently in God."2 Sin is the despairing refusal to find your deepest
identity in your relationship and service to God. Sin is seeking to become oneself, to get an identity, apart from him.
What does this mean? Everyone gets their identity, their sense of being distinct and valuable, from somewhere or something. Kierkegaard asserts that human beings were made not only to believe in God in
some general way, but to love him supremely, center their lives on him above anything else, and build their very identities on him. Anything other than this is sin.
Most people think of sin primarily as "breaking divine rules," but Kierkegaard knows that the very first of the Ten Commandments is to "have no other gods before me." So, according to the Bible, the primary
way to define sin is not just the doing of bad things, but the making of good things into ultimate things. It is seeking to establish a sense of self by making something else more central to your significance, purpose,
and happiness than your relationship to God.
In the movie Rocky, the title character's girlfriend asks him why it is so important for him to "go the distance" in the boxing match. "Then I'll know I'm not a bum," he replies. In the movie Chariots of Fire one of
the main characters explains why he works so hard at running the hundred-yard dash for the Olympics. He says that when each race begins, "I have ten lonely seconds to justify my existence." Both of these men
looked to athletic achievement as the defining force that gave meaning to their lives.
Ernest Becker won the Pulitzer Prize for his book The Denial of Death. He begins it by noting that a child's need for self-worth "is the condition for his life," so much so that every person is desperately seeking
what Becker calls "cosmic significance." He immediately warns the reader not to take this term lightly.4 Our need for worth is so powerful that whatever we base our identity and value on we essentially "deify." We
will look to it with all the passion and intensity of worship and devotion, even if we think of ourselves as highly irreligious. He uses romantic love as an illustration:
The self-glorification that [modern man] needed in his innermost nature he now looked for in the love partner. The love partner becomes the divine ideal within which to fulfill one's life. Spiritual and
moral needs now become focused on one individual.
Becker is not saying that everyone looks to romance and love for a sense of self. Many look not to romance but rather to work and career for cosmic significance:
[Sometimes] his work has to carry the burden of justifying him. What does "justifying" mean?...He lives the fantasy of the control of life and death, of destiny.
But all this only sets the stage for continual disappointment:
No human relationship can bear [this] burden of godhood.... If your partner is your "All" then any shortcoming in him becomes a major threat to you.... What is it that we want when we elevate the
love partner to this position? We want to be rid of...our feeling of nothingness…..to know our existence has not been in vain. We want redemption—nothing less. Needless to say, humans cannot give this.Z
This is exactly Kierkegaard's point. Every person must find some way to “justify their existence,” and to stave off the universal fear that they're “a bum." In more traditional cultures, the sense of worth and
identity comes from fulfilling duties to family and giving service to society. In our contemporary individualistic culture, we tend to look to our achievements, our social status, our talents, or our love relationships.
There are an infinite variety of identity-bases. Some get their sense of "self" from gaining and wielding power, others from human approval, others from self-discipline and control. But everyone is building their
identity on something.§

## The Personal Consequences of Sin

Defining sin this way, we can see several ways that sin destroys us personally. Identity apart from God is inherently unstable. Without God, our sense of worth may seem solid on the surface, but it never is—it can
desert you in a moment. For example, if I build my identity on being a good parent, I have no true “self”—I am just a parent, nothing more. If something goes wrong with my children or my parenting, there is no
"me" left. Theologian Thomas Oden writes:
Suppose my god is sex or my physical health or the Democratic Party. If I experience any of these under genuine threat, then I feel myself shaken to the depths. Guilt becomes neurotically intensified to
the degree that I have idolized finite values.... Suppose I value my ability to teach and communicate clearly.... If clear communication has become an absolute value for me, a center of value that makes
all my other values valuable...then if I [fail in teaching well] I am stricken with neurotic guilt. Bitterness becomes neurotically intensified when someone or something stands between me and something
that is my ultimate value.2
If anything threatens your identity you will not just be anxious but paralyzed with fear. If you lose your identity through the failings of someone else you will not just be resentful, but locked into bitterness. If
you lose it through your own failings, you will hate or despise yourself as a failure as long as you live. Only if your identity is built on God and his love, says Kierkegaard, can you have a self that can venture anything,
face anything.
There is no way to avoid this insecurity outside of God. Even if you say, "I will not build my happiness or significance on anyone or thing," you will actually be building your identity on your personal freedom
and independence. If anything threatens that, you will again be without a self.
An identity not based on God also leads inevitably to deep forms of addiction. When we turn good things into ultimate things, we are, as it were, spiritually addicted. If we take our meaning in life from our
family, our work, a cause, or some achievement other than God, they enslave us. We have to have them. St. Augustine said that "our loves are not rightly ordered." He famously said to God, "Our hearts are restless
until they find their rest in Thee!" If we try to find our ultimate rest in anything else, our hearts become dislocated, "out of joint." The good things that enslave us are good things that deserve to be loved. But when
our heart loves become inordinate, then we fall into patterns of life that are not unlike substance addiction. As in all addiction, we are in denial about the degree to which we are controlled by our god-substitutes.
And inordinate love creates inordinate, uncontrollable anguish if anything goes wrong with the object of our greatest hopes.
As a pastor at my first church in Hopewell, Virginia, I found myself counseling two different women, both of whom were married, both of whom had husbands who were poor fathers, and both of whom had
teenage sons who were beginning to get into trouble in school and with the law. Both of the women were angry at their husbands. I advised them and talked (among other things) about the problems of unresolved
bitterness and the importance of forgiveness. Both women agreed and sought to forgive. However, the woman who had the worst husband and who was the least religious was able to forgive. The other woman was
not. This puzzled me for months until one day the unforgiving woman blurted out, "Well, if my son goes down the drain then my whole life will have been a failure!" She had centered her life on her son's happiness
and success. That was why she couldn't forgive,10
In Easter Everywhere: A Memoir, Darcey Steinke recounts how she, the daughter of a Lutheran minister, left her Christian profession. Moving to New York City she entered a life of club-hopping and sexual
obsession. She wrote several novels. She continued, however, to be extremely restless and unfulfilled. In the middle of the book she quotes from Simone Weil to summarize the main issue in her life. "One has only
the choice between God and idolatry," Weil wrote. "If one denies God...one is worshiping some things of this world in the belief that one sees them only as such, but in fact, though unknown to oneself imagining
the attributes of Divinity in them."11
A life not centered on God leads to emptiness. Building our lives on something besides God not only hurts us if we don't get the desires of our hearts, but also if we do. Few of us get all of our wildest dreams
fulfilled in life, and therefore it is easy to live in the illusion that if you were as successful, wealthy, popular, or beautiful as you wished, you'd finally be happy and at peace. That just isn't so. In a Village Voice column,
Cynthia Heimel thought back on all the people she knew in New York City before they became famous movie stars. One worked behind the makeup counter at Macy's, one worked selling tickets at movie theaters,
and so on. When they became successful, every one of them became more angry, manic, unhappy, and unstable than they had been when they were working hard to get to the top. Why? Heimel writes:
That giant thing they were striving for, that fame thing that was going to make everything OK, that was going to make their lives bearable, that was going to fill them with ha-ha-happiness had
happened, and the next day they woke up and they were still them. The disillusionment turned them howling and insufferable.12
The Social Consequences of Sin
Sin does not only have an internal impact on us but also a devastating effect on the social fabric. In the wake of World War II the English writer Dorothy Sayers saw many British intellectual elites in despair about the
direction of human society. In her 1947 book Creed or Chaos? she proposed that their hopelessness was largely due to their loss of belief in the Christian doctrine of "original" sin, that is, humanity's inherent pride
and self-centeredness. "The people who are most discouraged,” she wrote, “are those who cling to an optimistic belief in the civilizing influence of progress and enlightenment." To them, the genocide in totalitarian
states and the greed and selfishness of capitalist society “are not merely shocking and alarming. For them, these things are the utter negation of everything in which they have believed. It is as though the bottom
had dropped out of their universe." Christians, however, are accustomed to the idea that “there is a deep interior dislocation in the very center of human personality." She concluded:
The Christian dogma of the double nature in man—which asserts that man is disintegrated and necessarily imperfect in himself and all his works, yet closely related by a real unity of substance with an
eternal perfection within and beyond him—makes the present parlous state of human society seem less hopeless and less irrational.13
In The Nature of True Virtue, one of the most profound treatises on social ethics ever written, Jonathan Edwards lays out how sin destroys the social fabric. He argues that human society is deeply fragmented
when anything but God is our highest love. If our highest goal in life is the good of our family, then, says Edwards, we will tend to care less for other families. If our highest goal is the good of our nation, tribe, or
race, then we will tend to be racist or nationalistic. If our ultimate goal in life is our own individual happiness, then we will put our own economic and power interests ahead of those of others. Edwards concludes
that only if God is our summum bonum, our ultimate good and life center, will we find our heart drawn out not only to people of all families, races, and classes, but to the whole world in general.14
How does this destruction of social relationships flow from the internal effects of sin? If we get our very identity, our sense of worth, from our political position, then politics is not really about politics, it is about
us. Through our cause we are getting a self, our worth. That means we must despise and demonize the opposition. If we get our identity from our ethnicity or socioeconomic status, then we have to feel superior to
those of other classes and races. If you are profoundly proud of being an open-minded, tolerant soul, you will be extremely indignant toward people you think are bigots. If you are a very moral person, you will feel
very superior to people you think are licentious. And so on.
There is no way out of this conundrum. The more we love and identify deeply with our family, our class, our race, or our religion, the harder it is to not feel superior or even hostile to other religions, races, etc. So
racism, classism, and sexism are not matters of ignorance or a lack of education. Foucault and others in our time have shown that it is far harder than we think to have a self-identity that doesn't lead to exclusion.
The real culture war is taking place inside our own disordered hearts, wracked by inordinate desires for things that control us, that lead us to feel superior and exclude those without them, and that fail to satisfy
us even when we get them.
The Cosmic Consequences of Sin
The Bible speaks even more comprehensively (and more mysteriously) about the effects of sin than we have indicated so far. The first and second chapters of Genesis show God speaking the world into being and,
almost literally, getting his hands dirty. "And God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" (Genesis 2:7). The contrast with all other ancient creation accounts could
not be greater.
In most ancient creation accounts, creation is the by-product of some kind of warfare or other act of violence. Virtually never is the creation deliberate and planned. Secular scientific accounts of the origin of
things are, interestingly, almost identical to the older pagan ones. The physical shape of the world as well as the biological life is the product of violent forces.
Unique among the creation accounts, the Bible depicts a world that is brimming with dynamic, abundant forms of life that are perfectly interwoven, interdependent, and mutually enhancing and enriching. The
Creator's response to this is delight. He keeps repeating that it is all good. When he creates human beings he instructs them to continue to cultivate and draw out the vast resources of creation like a gardener does
in a garden. "Go keep this going," the Creator seems to be saying in Genesis 1:28, "Have a ball!"15
The Hebrew word for this perfect, harmonious interdependence among all parts of creation is called shalom. We translate it as "peace," but the English word is basically negative, referring to the absence of
trouble or hostility. The Hebrew word means much more than that. It means absolute wholeness-full, harmonious, joyful, flourishing life.
The devastating loss of shalom through sin is described in Genesis 3. We are told that as soon as we determined to serve ourselves instead of God—as soon as we abandoned living for and enjoying God as
our highest good—the entire created world became broken. Human beings are so integral to the fabric of things that when human beings turned from God the entire warp and woof of the world unraveled.
Disease, genetic disorders, famine, natural disasters, aging, and death itself are as much the result of sin as are oppression, war, crime, and violence. We have lost God's shalom-physically, spiritually, socially,
psychologically, culturally. Things now fall apart. In Romans 8, Paul says that the entire world is now "in bondage to decay” and “subject to futility” and will not be put right until we are put right.
What Can Put It All Right?
At some point in most lives, we are confronted with the fact that we are not the persons we know we should be. Almost always our response is to "turn over a new leaf" and try harder to live according to our
principles. That ultimately will only lead us into a spiritual dead end.
In C. S. Lewis's essay "Is Christianity Hard or Easy?" he depicts normal human striving:
The ordinary idea which we all have is that...we have a natural self with various desires and interests...and we know something called “morality” or “decent behavior” has a claim on the self.... We are
all hoping that when all the demands of morality and society have been met, the poor natural self will still have some chance, some time, to get on with its own life and do what it likes. In fact, we are
very like an honest man paying his taxes. He pays them, but he does hope that there will be enough left over for him to live on.
The Christian way is different-both harder and easier. Christ says, "Give me ALL. I don't want just this much of your time and this much of your money and this much of your work—so that your
natural self can have the rest. I want you. Not your things. I have come not to torture your natural self...I will give you a new self instead. Hand over the whole natural self-ALL the desires, not just the
ones you think wicked but the ones you think innocent—the whole outfit. I will give you a new self instead.”"
Here Lewis works from Kierkegaard's definition of sin. Sin is not simply doing bad things, it is putting good things in the place of God. So the only solution is not simply to change our behavior, but to reorient
and center the entire heart and life on God.
The almost impossibly hard thing is to hand over your whole self to Christ. But it is far easier than what we are all trying to do instead. For what we are trying to do is remain what we call "ourselves”—
our personal happiness centered on money or pleasure or ambition—and hoping, despite this, to behave honestly and chastely and humbly. And that is exactly what Christ warned us you cannot do. If I
am a grass field—all the cutting will keep the grass less but won't produce wheat. If I want wheat...I must be plowed up and re-sown.
Does that scare you? Does it sound stifling? Remember this if you don't live for Jesus you will live for something else. If you live for career and you don't do well it may punish you all of your life, and
feel like a failure. If you live for your children and they don't turn out all right you could be absolutely in torment because you feel worthless as a person.
you will
If Jesus is your center and Lord and you fail him, he will forgive you. Your career can't die for your sins. You might say, "If I were a Christian I'd be going around pursued by guilt all the time!" But we all are being
pursued by guilt because we must have an identity and there must be some standard to live up to by which we get that identity. Whatever you base your life on-you have to live up to that. Jesus is the one Lord you
can live for who died for you-who breathed his last breath for you. Does that sound oppressive?
You may say, "I see that Christianity might be just the thing for people who have had collapses in their lives. But what if I don't fail in my career and what if I have a great family?" As Augustine said, if there is a
God who created you, then the deepest chambers of your soul simply cannot be filled up by anything less. That is how great the human soul is. If Jesus is the Creator-Lord, then by definition nothing could satisfy
you like he can, even if you are successful. Even the most successful careers and families cannot give the significance, security, and affirmation that the author of glory and love can.
Everybody has to live for something. Whatever that something is becomes "Lord of your life," whether you think of it that way or not. Jesus is the only Lord who, if you receive him, will fulfill you completely,
and, if you fail him, will forgive you eternally.
