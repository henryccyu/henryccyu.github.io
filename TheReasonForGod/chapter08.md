# EIGHT THE CLUES OF GOD
If one puts aside the existence of God and the survival after life as too doubtful...one has to make up one's mind as to the use of life. If death ends all, if I have neither to hope for good nor to fear evil, I
must ask myself what I am here for, and how in these circumstances I must conduct myself. Now the answer is plain, but so unpalatable that most will not face it. There is no meaning for life, and [thus]
life has no meaning.  
-Somerset Maugham, The Summing Up

It was true, I had always realized it-I hadn't any "right" to exist at all. I had appeared by chance, I existed like a stone, a plant, a microbe. I could feel nothing to myself but an inconsequential buzzing.
I was thinking...that here we are eating and drinking, to preserve our precious existence, and that there's nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.  
-Jean-Paul Sartre, Nausea

How can we believe in Christianity if we don't even know whether God exists? Though there cannot be irrefutable proof for the existence of God, many people have found strong clues for his reality-divine
fingerprints-in many places.

I once met regularly with a brilliant young scientist who was haunted by a general sense that God existed. Much of what I am writing in this chapter and the next I discovered during my conversations with him.
He looked at one argument for God after another, and though many of them had a great deal of merit, he found that ultimately every one of them was rationally avoidable at some point. This troubled him greatly.
"I can't believe unless I find at least one absolutely airtight proof for God," he said to me. I pointed out to him that he was assuming "strong rationalism" and he got some relief when together we realized that he had
no airtight proof for that. Then we began to go back and review the lines of reasoning that he had been calling "proofs" and began to look at them instead as clues. When we went about it with that perspective he
began to see that, cumulatively, the clues of God had a lot of force to them.

The philosopher Alvin Plantinga believes that there are no proofs of God that will convince all rational persons. However, he believes that there are at least two to three dozen very good arguments for the
existence of God. Most readers who take the time to think through Plantinga's list will find some items compelling and others not. However, the accumulated weight of the ones you find appealing can be very
formidable. I will trace out just a handful of them.

## The Mysterious Bang

Those of a more rational mind-set have always been fascinated by the question, "Why is there something rather than nothing?" This question has become even more interesting to people in the wake of the Big Bang
theory. There's evidence that the universe is expanding explosively and outwardly from a single point. Stephen Hawking wrote: "Almost everyone now believes that the universe, and time itself, had a beginning at
the Big Bang."2 Scientist Francis Collins puts this clue in layman's language in his book The Language of God:
