# SEVEN YOU CAN'T TAKE THE BIBLE LITERALLY
"I see much of the Bible's teaching as historically inaccurate," said Charles, an investment banker. "We can't be sure the Bible's account of events is what really happened."

"I'm sure you're right, Charles," answered Jaclyn, a woman working in finance. â€œBut my biggest problem with the Bible is that it is culturally obsolete. Much of the Bible's social teaching (for example,
about women) is socially regressive. So it is impossible to accept the Bible as the complete authority Christians think it is."

WHEN I was in college in the late 1960s I took some courses on the Bible as literature and was confronted with the prevailing wisdom of the time. My professors taught that the New Testament gospels originated
as the oral traditions of various church communities around the Mediterranean. These stories about Jesus were shaped by those communities to address the questions and needs peculiar to each church. Leaders
made certain that the Jesus in these stories supported the policies and beliefs of their communities. The oral traditions were then passed down over the years, evolving through the addition of various legendary
materials. Finally, long after the actual events, the gospels assumed written form. By then it was almost impossible to know to what degree, if any, they represented the actual historical events.

Who then was the original Jesus? The scholars I read proposed that the real, "historical Jesus" was a charismatic teacher of justice and wisdom who provoked opposition and was executed. After his death, they
said, different parties and viewpoints emerged among his followers about who he was. Some claimed he was divine and risen from the dead, others that he was just a human teacher who lived on spiritually in the
hearts of his disciples. After a power struggle, the "divine Jesus" party won and created texts that promoted its views. They allegedly suppressed and destroyed all the alternative texts showing us a different sort of
Jesus. Recently, some of these suppressed, alternate views of Jesus have come to light-like the "Gnostic" gospels of Thomas and Judas. This shows, it is said, that early Christianity was very diverse in its doctrinal
beliefs.

If this view of the New Testament's origins and development is true, it would radically change our understanding of the content and meaning of Christianity itself. It would mean that no one could really know
what Jesus said and did, and that the Bible could not be the authoritative norm over our life and beliefs. It would mean that most of the classic Christian teachings-Jesus's deity, atonement, and resurrection-are
mistaken and based on legends.

As a student I was initially shaken by this. How could all of these prominent scholars be wrong? Then, however, as I did my own firsthand research, I was surprised at how little evidence there actually was for
these historical reconstructions. To my encouragement the evidence for this older, skeptical view of the Bible has been crumbling steadily for the past thirty years, even as it has been promoted by the popular media
through books and movies such as The Da Vinci Code.

Anne Rice was one person who was startled to discover how weak the case for a merely human "historical Jesus" really is. Rice became famous as the author of Interview with the Vampire and other works that
could be called "horror-erotica." Raised a Catholic, she lost her faith at a secular college, married an atheist, and became wealthy writing novels about Lestat, who is both a vampire and a rock star. It shocked the
literary and media world when Rice announced that she had returned to Christianity.

Why did she do it? In the afterword to her new novel, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt, she explained that she had begun doing extensive research about the historical Jesus by reading the work of Jesus scholars at
the most respected academic institutions. Their main thesis was that the Biblical documents we have aren't historically reliable. She was amazed at how weak their arguments were.
