# SEVEN YOU CAN'T TAKE THE BIBLE LITERALLY
"I see much of the Bible's teaching as historically inaccurate," said Charles, an investment banker. "We can't be sure the Bible's account of events is what really happened."

"I'm sure you're right, Charles," answered Jaclyn, a woman working in finance. “But my biggest problem with the Bible is that it is culturally obsolete. Much of the Bible's social teaching (for example,
about women) is socially regressive. So it is impossible to accept the Bible as the complete authority Christians think it is."

WHEN I was in college in the late 1960s I took some courses on the Bible as literature and was confronted with the prevailing wisdom of the time. My professors taught that the New Testament gospels originated
as the oral traditions of various church communities around the Mediterranean. These stories about Jesus were shaped by those communities to address the questions and needs peculiar to each church. Leaders
made certain that the Jesus in these stories supported the policies and beliefs of their communities. The oral traditions were then passed down over the years, evolving through the addition of various legendary
materials. Finally, long after the actual events, the gospels assumed written form. By then it was almost impossible to know to what degree, if any, they represented the actual historical events.

Who then was the original Jesus? The scholars I read proposed that the real, "historical Jesus" was a charismatic teacher of justice and wisdom who provoked opposition and was executed. After his death, they
said, different parties and viewpoints emerged among his followers about who he was. Some claimed he was divine and risen from the dead, others that he was just a human teacher who lived on spiritually in the
hearts of his disciples. After a power struggle, the "divine Jesus" party won and created texts that promoted its views. They allegedly suppressed and destroyed all the alternative texts showing us a different sort of
Jesus. Recently, some of these suppressed, alternate views of Jesus have come to light-like the "Gnostic" gospels of Thomas and Judas. This shows, it is said, that early Christianity was very diverse in its doctrinal
beliefs.

If this view of the New Testament's origins and development is true, it would radically change our understanding of the content and meaning of Christianity itself. It would mean that no one could really know
what Jesus said and did, and that the Bible could not be the authoritative norm over our life and beliefs. It would mean that most of the classic Christian teachings-Jesus's deity, atonement, and resurrection-are
mistaken and based on legends.

As a student I was initially shaken by this. How could all of these prominent scholars be wrong? Then, however, as I did my own firsthand research, I was surprised at how little evidence there actually was for
these historical reconstructions. To my encouragement the evidence for this older, skeptical view of the Bible has been crumbling steadily for the past thirty years, even as it has been promoted by the popular media
through books and movies such as The Da Vinci Code.

Anne Rice was one person who was startled to discover how weak the case for a merely human "historical Jesus" really is. Rice became famous as the author of Interview with the Vampire and other works that
could be called "horror-erotica." Raised a Catholic, she lost her faith at a secular college, married an atheist, and became wealthy writing novels about Lestat, who is both a vampire and a rock star. It shocked the
literary and media world when Rice announced that she had returned to Christianity.

Why did she do it? In the afterword to her new novel, Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt, she explained that she had begun doing extensive research about the historical Jesus by reading the work of Jesus scholars at
the most respected academic institutions. Their main thesis was that the Biblical documents we have aren't historically reliable. She was amazed at how weak their arguments were.

Some books were no more than assumptions piled on assumptions.... Conclusions were reached on the basis of little or no data at all.... The whole case for the nondivine Jesus who stumbled into Jerusalem
and somehow got crucified...that whole picture which had floated around the liberal circles I frequented as an atheist for thirty years that case was not made. Not only was it not made, I discovered in
this field some of the worst and most biased scholarship I'd ever read.1

The Christian faith requires belief in the Bible. This is a big stumbling block for many. I meet many New Yorkers for the first time after they have been invited to one of Redeemer's services. The centerpiece of
each service is a sermon based on a text of the Bible. The average visitor is surprised or even shocked to find us listening to the Bible so carefully. Most would say that they know there are many great stories and
sayings in the Bible, but today "you can't take it literally." What they mean is that the Bible is not entirely trustworthy because some parts-maybe many or most parts are scientifically impossible, historically
unreliable, and culturally regressive. We looked at the first of these issues, of science and the Bible, in the previous chapter. Now we will look at the other two.

"We Can't Trust the Bible Historically"

It is widely believed that the Bible is a historically unreliable collection of legends. A highly publicized forum of scholars, "the Jesus Seminar," has stated that no more than 20 percent of Jesus's sayings and actions
in the Bible can be historically validated.2 How do we respond to this? It is beyond the range of this book to examine the historic accuracy of each part of the Bible. Instead, we will ask whether we can trust the
gospels, the New Testament accounts of Jesus's life, to be historically reliable.4 By this I mean the "canonical" gospels-Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John-that the church recognized very early on as authentic and
authoritative.

It is often asserted that the New Testament gospels were written so many years after the events happened that the writers' accounts of Jesus's life can't be trusted that they are highly embellished if not wholly
imagined. Many believe that the canonical gospels were only four out of scores of other texts and that they were written to support the church hierarchy's power while the rest (including the so-called "Gnostic
gospels") were suppressed. This belief has been given new plausibility in the popular imagination by the bestselling book The Da Vinci Code. In this novel, the original Jesus is depicted as a great but clearly human
teacher who many years after his death was made into a resurrected God by church leaders who did so to gain status in the Roman empire. However, there are several good reasons why the gospel accounts should
be considered historically reliable rather than legends.

The timing is far too early for the gospels to be legends.

The canonical gospels were written at the very most forty to sixty years after Jesus's death. Paul's letters, written just fifteen to twenty-five years after the death of Jesus, provide an outline of all the events of Jesus's
life found in the gospels-his miracles, claims, crucifixion, and resurrection. This means that the Biblical accounts of Jesus's life were circulating within the lifetimes of hundreds who had been present at the events
of his ministry. The gospel author Luke claims that he got his account of Jesus's life from eyewitnesses who were still alive (Luke 1:1-4).

In his landmark book Jesus and the Eyewitnesses, Richard Bauckham marshals much historical evidence to demonstrate that at the time the gospels were written there were still numerous well-known living
eyewitnesses to Jesus's teaching and life events. They had committed them to memory and they remained active in the public life of the churches throughout their lifetimes, serving as ongoing sources and
guarantors of the truth of those accounts. Bauckham uses evidence within the gospels themselves to show that the gospel writers named their eyewitness sources within the text to assure readers of their accounts'
authenticity.

Mark, for example, says that the man who helped Jesus carry his cross to Calvary "was the father of Alexander and Rufus” (Mark 15:21). There is no reason for the author to include such names unless the readers
know or could have access to them. Mark is saying, “Alexander and Rufus vouch for the truth of what I am telling you, if you want to ask them.” Paul also appeals to readers to check with living eyewitnesses if they
want to establish the truth of what he is saying about the events of Jesus's life (1 Corinthians 15:1-6). Paul refers to a body of five hundred eyewitnesses who saw the risen Christ at once. You can't write that in a
document designed for public reading unless there really were surviving witnesses whose testimony agreed and who could confirm what the author said. All this decisively refutes the idea that the gospels were
anonymous, collective, evolving oral traditions. Instead they were oral histories taken down from the mouths of the living eyewitnesses who preserved the words and deeds of Jesus in great detail.
It is not only Christ's supporters who were still alive. Also still alive were many bystanders, officials, and opponents who had actually heard him teach, seen his actions, and watched him die. They would have
been especially ready to challenge any accounts that were fabricated. For a highly altered, fictionalized account of an event to take hold in the public imagination it is necessary that the eyewitnesses (and their
children and grandchildren) all be long dead. They must be off the scene so they cannot contradict or debunk the embellishments and falsehoods of the story. The gospels were written far too soon for this to occur.
It would have been impossible, then, for this new faith to spread as it did had Jesus never said or done the things mentioned in the gospel accounts. Paul could confidently assert to government officials that
the events of Jesus's life were public knowledge: "These things were not done in a corner," he said to King Agrippa (Acts 26:26). The people of Jerusalem had been there they had been in the crowds that heard and
watched Jesus. The New Testament documents could not say Jesus was crucified when thousands of people were still alive who knew whether he was or not. If there had not been appearances after his death, if there
had not been an empty tomb, if he had not made these claims, and these public documents claimed they happened, Christianity would never have gotten off the ground. The hearers would have simply laughed at
the accounts.
The four canonical gospels were written much earlier than the so-called Gnostic gospels. The Gospel of Thomas, the best known of the Gnostic documents, is a translation from the Syriac, and scholars have
shown that the Syriac traditions in Thomas can be dated to 175 A.D. at the earliest, more than a hundred years after the time that the canonical gospels were in widespread use. Adam Gopnik in The New Yorker wrote
that the Gnostic gospels were so late that they "...no more challenge the basis of the Church's faith than the discovery of a document from the nineteenth century written in Ohio and defending King George would
be a challenge to the basis of American democracy."10 The gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, however, were recognized as authoritative eyewitness accounts almost immediately, and so we have Irenaeus of
Lyons in 160 A.D. declaring that there were four, and only four, gospels. The widespread idea, promoted by The Da Vinci Code, that the Emperor Constantine determined the New Testament canon, casting aside the
earlier and supposedly more authentic Gnostic gospels, simply is not true.11
As for The Da Vinci Code, people know the book and the movie plot is fictitious, but many find plausible the historical background that the author, Dan Brown, claims is true. The bestseller depicts Constantine
in 325 A.D. as decreeing Jesus's divinity and suppressing all the evidence that he was just a human teacher. Even in a document like Paul's letter to the Philippians, however, which all historians date at no more
than twenty years after the death of Christ, we see that Christians were worshipping Jesus as God (Philippians 2). Belief in the deity of Christ was part of the dynamic from the beginning in the growth of the early
Christian church. One historian comments:
[Dan Brown says] that the Emperor Constantine imposed a whole new interpretation on Christianity at the Council of Nicea in 325. That is, he decreed the belief in Jesus' divinity and suppressed all
evidence of his humanity. This would mean Christianity won the religious competition in the Roman Empire by an exercise of power rather than by any attraction it exerted. In actual historical fact, the
Church had won that competition long before that time, before it had any power, when it was still under sporadic persecution. If a historian were cynical, you would say Constantine chose Christianity
because it had already won and he wanted to back a winner, 12
The content is far too counterproductive for the gospels to be legends.
The working theory of many people today is that the gospels were written by the leaders of the early church to promote their policies, consolidate their power, and build their movement. That theory does not fit at
all with what we actually find in the gospels.
If this popular view is correct, we would expect to see many places in the gospels where Jesus takes sides in debates that were going on in the early church. That is how (it is reasoned) the gospels were shaped by
Christian leaders to support their party. However, we do not find this. We know, for example, that one of the great controversies in the earliest church was that some believed Gentile Christians should be required
to be circumcised. In light of that great conflict, it is remarkable that nowhere in the gospel accounts does Jesus say anything about circumcision. The most likely reason that Jesus is silent about circumcision is that
the early church did not feel free to fabricate things and put words in Jesus's mouth that he didn't utter.
Why would the leaders of the early Christian movement have made up the story of the crucifixion if it didn't happen? Any listener of the gospel in either Greek or Jewish culture would have automatically
suspected that anyone who had been crucified was a criminal, whatever the speaker said to the contrary. Why would any Christian make up the account of Jesus asking God in the garden of Gethsemane if he could get out of his mission? Or why ever make up the part on the cross when Jesus cries out that God had abandoned him? These things would have only offended or deeply confused first-century prospective converts.
They would have concluded that Jesus was weak and failing his God. Why invent women as the first witnesses of the resurrection in a society where women were assigned such low status that their testimony
was not admissible evidence in court?13 It would have made far more sense (if you were inventing the tale) to have male pillars of the community present as witnesses when Jesus came out of the tomb. The only
plausible reason that all of these incidents would be included in these accounts is that they actually happened.
Also, why constantly depict the apostles-the eventual leaders of the early Church-as petty and jealous, almost impossibly slow-witted, and in the end as cowards who either actively or passively failed their
master? Richard Bauckham makes similar arguments about the depiction of Peter's denial of Jesus, even to the point of his calling down a curse on his master (Mark 14:71). Why would anyone in the early church
want to play up the terrible failures of their most prominent leader? No one would have made such a story up, and even though it is true, Bauckham reasons that no one but Peter himself would have dared to recount
it unless Peter himself was the source and had authorized its preservation and propagation.14
Again, a comparison with the "Gnostic gospels" is illuminating. The gospel of Thomas and similar documents express a philosophy called "Gnosticism," in which the material world is a dark, evil place from
which our spirits need to be rescued by secret illumination, or "gnosis." This fits in very well with the worldview of the Greeks and Romans but is utterly different than that of the first-century Jewish world of which
Jesus was part.15 Contrary, then, to The Da Vinci Code and similar accounts, it is not the canonical gospels that "suck up" to the "powers that be" in the ancient world, but it is the Gnostic texts that do it. It was the
canonical gospels, with their positive view of material creation and their emphasis on the poor and the oppressed that offended the dominant views of the Greco-Roman world. The canonical gospels not only give
us a far more historically credible picture of what the original Jesus was really like, but they boldly challenge the worldview of their Greek and Roman readers.
The literary form of the gospels is too detailed to be legend.

C. S. Lewis was a world-class literary critic. When reading the gospels, he noted:
> I have been reading poems, romances, vision literature, legends, and myths all my life. I know what they are like. I know none of them are like this. Of this [gospel] text there are only two possible views.
Either this is reportage...or else, some unknown [ancient] writer...without known predecessors or successors, suddenly anticipated the whole technique of modern novelistic, realistic narrative...

Lewis meant that ancient fiction was nothing like modern fiction. Modern fiction is realistic. It contains details and dialogue and reads like an eyewitness account. This genre of fiction, however, only developed
within the last three hundred years. In ancient times, romances, epics, or legends were high and remote details were spare and only included if they promoted character development or drove the plot. That is why
if you are reading Beowulf or The Iliad you don't see characters noticing the rain or falling asleep with a sigh. In modern novels, details are added to create the aura of realism, but that was never the case in ancient
fiction.
The gospel accounts are not fiction. In Mark 4, we are told that Jesus was asleep on a cushion in the stern of a boat. In John 21 we are told that Peter was a hundred yards out in the water when he saw Jesus on
the beach. He then jumped out of the boat and together they caught 153 fish. In John 8, as Jesus listened to the men who caught a woman in adultery, we are told he doodled with his finger in the dust. We are never
told what he was writing or why he did it. None of these details are relevant to the plot or character development at all. If you or I were making up an exciting story about Jesus, we would include such remarks just
to fill out the story's air of realism. But that kind of fictional writing was unknown in the first century. The only explanation for why an ancient writer would mention the cushion, the 153 fish, and the doodling in
the dust is because the details had been retained in the eyewitnesses' memory.
Richard Bauckham has compiled a great deal of research by psychologists on the marks of recollective memory. He looks at the marks of eyewitness accounts of events and how they differ from speculative
or fictional accounts, or of composite historical reconstructions. Recollective memory is selective-it fixes on unique and consequential events, it retains irrelevant detail (as Lewis observes), it takes the limited
vantage point of a participant rather than that of an omniscient narrator, and it shows signs of frequent rehearsal.17 Bauckham then shows these same marks in the gospel narratives. Vivid and important events
can stay with you for decades if frequently rehearsed and/or retold. Factor in the fact that disciples in the ancient world were expected to memorize masters' teachings, and that many of Jesus's statements are
presented in a form that was actually designed for memorization, and you have every reason to trust the accounts.

Bauckham also looks to anthropology for evidence that the gospel writers did not feel free to embellish or fabricate words or events in the life of Jesus. Critical scholars from earlier in the twentieth century
assumed the early Christians would have used a relatively fluid process for transmitting popular folktales and that they would have felt free to change the tales from the past in order to correspond to their present
realities and situation. Bauckham, however, cites Jan Vansina's study of oral traditions in primitive African cultures, in which fictional legends and historical accounts are clearly distinguished from each other and
much greater care is taken to preserve historical accounts accurately. This finding undermines a hundred years of critical gospel scholarship.
Gospels scholars, from the form critics onward, [believed] that early Christians in the transmission of Jesus traditions would not have made any distinction between the past time of the history of Jesus
and their own present because oral societies do not make such distinctions. This is untrue. 18
As I write today, there seems to be a flood of what David Van Biema of Time magazine calls "Biblical revisionism" following in the footsteps of Dan Brown and The Da Vinci Code. He refers to the recent claim
that Jesus's tomb has been found, and that he married Mary Magdalene and had children. Other scholars have published books claiming similar new insights from the Gnostic gospels. More seem sure to come. Van
Biema quotes Publishers Weekly senior religion editor Lynn Garrett, who speaks of what she calls "the Da Vinci Code effect": "Speculative histories were out there before Dan Brown wrote," says Garrett. "But they
didn't make the bestseller lists and their authors didn't go on The Daily Show."12
All these revisionist histories completely ignore the growing body of careful scholarship that shows there were a very large number of eyewitnesses to Jesus's life who lived on for years. As British scholar
Vincent Taylor famously remarked, if the skeptics about the Bible are right, "the disciples must have been translated into heaven immediately after the resurrection."20 That is the only way that legendary elements
could have come into the story of Jesus by the time the gospels were written, but that did not happen. So, ironically, as the popular media is promoting accounts of Jesus's life based on the highly skeptical Biblical
scholarship that arose a century ago, the actual foundations of that scholarship are eroding fast.21
"We can't trust the Bible culturally."
When I first came to New York City almost twenty years ago, the main problem people had with the Bible was in the areas just discussed-science and history. Today things have shifted somewhat. I find more people
now especially upset by what they call the outmoded and regressive teaching of the Bible. It seems to support slavery and the subjugation of women. These positions appear so outrageous to contemporary people
that they have trouble accepting any other parts of the Bible's message.
In the early days of Redeemer I spent a lot of time with people who were reading the Bible for the first time. As a result I was constantly responding to people who were choking on some particularly indigestible
verse. I remember one black-clad young artist who came up to me after a service. He had just discovered the verse "slaves obey your masters" (Ephesians 6:5ff.) and was almost apoplectic. Here's how I advised him
and other people on how to deal with a Scripture text that appeared objectionable or offensive to them.
Many people simply run viscerally from any consideration of the Bible once they find such a Biblical passage. I counsel them instead to slow down and try out several different perspectives on the issues that
trouble them. That way they can continue to read, learn, and profit from the Bible even as they continue to wrestle with some of its concepts.
One possibility I urge them to consider is that the passage that bothers them might not teach what it appears to them to be teaching. Many of the texts people find offensive can be cleared up with a decent
commentary that puts the issue into historical context. Take the text "slaves obey your masters." The average reader today immediately and understandably thinks of the African slave trade of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, or of the human trafficking and sexual slavery practiced in many places today. We then interpret the texts to teach that such slavery is permissible, even desirable.
This is a classic case of ignoring the cultural and historical distance between us and the writer and readers of the original text. In the first-century Roman empire, when the New Testament was written, there
was not a great difference between slaves and the average free person. Slaves were not distinguishable from others by race, speech, or clothing. They looked and lived like most everyone else, and were not segregated
from the rest of society in any way. From a financial standpoint, slaves made the same wages as free laborers, and therefore were not usually poor. Also, slaves could accrue enough personal capital to buy themselves
out. Most important of all, very few slaves were slaves for life. Most could reasonably hope to be manumitted within ten or fifteen years, or by their late thirties at the latest.22
By contrast, New World slavery was much more systematically and homogeneously brutal. It was "chattel" slavery, in which the slave's whole person was the property of the master he or she could be raped or
maimed or killed at the will of the owner. In the older bond-service or indentured servanthood, only slaves' productivity-their time and skills—were owned by the master, and only temporarily. African slavery, however, was race-based, and its default mode was slavery for life. Also, the African slave trade was begun and resourced through kidnapping. The Bible unconditionally condemns kidnapping and trafficking in
slaves (1 Timothy 1:9-11; cf. Deuteronomy 24:7). Therefore, while the early Christians did not go on a campaign to abolish first-century slavery completely, later Christians did so when faced with New World-style
slavery, which could not be squared in any way with Biblical teaching.23
Some texts may not teach what they at first appear to teach. Some people, however, have studied particular Biblical texts carefully and come to understand what they teach, and yet they still find them
outrageous and regressive. What should they do then?
I urge people to consider that their problem with some texts might be based on an unexamined belief in the superiority of their historical moment over all others. We must not universalize our time any more
than we should universalize our culture. Think of the implication of the very term "regressive." To reject the Bible as regressive is to assume that you have now arrived at the ultimate historic moment, from which
all that is regressive and progressive can be discerned. That belief is surely as narrow and exclusive as the views in the Bible you regard as offensive.
Consider the views of contemporary British people and how they differ from the views of their ancestors, the Anglo-Saxons, a thousand years ago. Imagine that both are reading the Bible and they come to the
gospel of Mark, chapter 14. First they read that Jesus claims to be the Son of Man, who will come with angels at the end of time to judge the whole world according to his righteousness (verse 62). Later they read
about Peter, the leading apostle, who denies his master three times and at the end even curses him to save his skin (verse 71). Yet later Peter is forgiven and restored to leadership (Mark 16:7; John 21:15ff.). The first
story will make contemporary British people shudder. It sounds so judgmental and exclusive. However, they will love the story about how even Peter can be restored and forgiven. The first story will not bother
the Anglo-Saxons at all. They know all about Domesday, and they are glad to get more information about it! However, they will be shocked at the second story. Disloyalty and betrayal at Peter's level must never be
forgiven, in their view. He doesn't deserve to live, let alone become the foremost disciple. They will be so appalled by this that they will want to throw the Bible down and read no more of it.
Of course, we think of the Anglo-Saxons as primitive, but someday others will think of us and our culture's dominant views as primitive. How can we use our time's standard of "progressive" as the plumbline by
which we decide which parts of the Bible are valid and which are not? Many of the beliefs of our grandparents and great-grandparents now seem silly and even embarrassing to us. That process is not going to stop
now. Our grandchildren will find many of our views outmoded as well. Wouldn't it be tragic if we threw the Bible away over a belief that will soon look pretty weak or wrong? To stay away from Christianity because
part of the Bible's teaching is offensive to you assumes that if there is a God he wouldn't have any views that upset you. Does that belief make sense?
I have one more bit of advice to people struggling with some of the Bible's teaching. We should make sure we distinguish between the major themes and message of the Bible and its less primary teachings. The
Bible talks about the person and work of Christ and also about how widows should be regarded in the church. The first of these subjects is much more foundational. Without it the secondary teachings don't make
sense. We should therefore consider the Bible's teachings in their proper order.
Let's take a hot issue today as a good example. If you say, "I can't accept what the Bible says about gender roles," you must keep in mind that Christians themselves differ over what some texts mean, as they do
about many, many other things. However, they all confess in the words of the Apostle's Creed that Jesus rose from the dead on the third day. Don't worry about gender roles until you figure out what you think about
the central teachings of the faith.
You may appeal, "But I can't accept the Bible if what it says about gender is outmoded." I would respond to that with this question—are you saying that because you don't like what the Bible says about sex that
Jesus couldn't have been raised from the dead? I'm sure you wouldn't insist on such a non sequitur. If Jesus is the Son of God, then we have to take his teaching seriously, including his confidence in the authority of
the whole Bible. If he is not who he says he is, why should we care what the Bible says about anything else?
Think of it like this. If you dive into the shallow end of the Biblical pool, where there are many controversies over interpretation, you may get scraped up. But if you dive into the center of the Biblical pool, where
there is consensus-about the deity of Christ, his death and resurrection-you will be safe. It is therefore important to consider the Bible's core claims about who Jesus is and whether he rose from the dead before
you reject it for its less central and more controversial teachings.
A Trustworthy Bible or a Stepford God?
If we let our unexamined beliefs undermine our confidence in the Bible, the cost may be greater than we think.
If you don't trust the Bible enough to let it challenge and correct your thinking, how could you ever have a personal relationship with God? In any truly personal relationship, the other person has to be able to
contradict you. For example, if a wife is not allowed to contradict her husband, they won't have an intimate relationship. Remember the (two!) movies The Stepford Wives? The husbands of Stepford, Connecticut, decide to have their wives turned into robots who never cross the wills of their husbands. A Stepford wife was wonderfully compliant and beautiful, but no one would describe such a marriage as intimate or
personal.

Now, what happens if you eliminate anything from the Bible that offends your sensibility and crosses your will? If you pick and choose what you want to believe and reject the rest, how will you ever have a God
who can contradict you? You won't! You'll have a Stepford God! A God, essentially, of your own making, and not a God with whom you can have a relationship and genuine interaction. Only if your God can say things
that outrage you and make you struggle (as in a real friendship or marriage!) will you know that you have gotten hold of a real God and not a figment of your imagination. So an authoritative Bible is not the enemy
of a personal relationship with God. It is the precondition for it.
