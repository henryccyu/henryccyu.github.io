# SIX - SCIENCE HAS DISPROVED CHRISTIANITY
"My scientific training makes it difficult if not impossible to accept the teachings of Christianity," said Thomas, a young Asian medical resident. "As a believer in evolution, I can't accept the Bible's
prescientific accounts of the origin of life."

"And the Bible is filled with accounts of miracles," added Michelle, a med student. "They simply could not have happened."

THE bestselling books by Richard Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennett, and Sam Harris assume that science in general, and evolutionary science in particular, has made belief in God unnecessary and obsolete. Dawkins
said very famously that "although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."1 In The God Delusion he goes much further. He argues
that you cannot be an intelligent scientific thinker and still hold religious beliefs. It is one or the other. To support his thesis he points out that a study in 1998 showed that only about 7 percent of American
scientists in the National Academy of Sciences believe in a personal God.2 This is proof that the more intelligent, rational, and scientifically minded you are, the less you will be able to believe in God.
Is Dawkins right? Has science essentially disproved Christian beliefs? Must we choose between thinking scientifically and belief in God?

Aren't Miracles Scientifically Impossible?

The first reason that many people think science has disproved traditional religion is that most of the major faiths believe in miracles, the intervention of God into the natural order. The miraculous is particularly
important for Christian belief. Christians annually celebrate the miracle of the incarnation, the birth of Jesus, each Christmas, and the miracle of the bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead each Easter. The New
Testament is filled with accounts of miracles that Jesus performed during the course of his ministry. Scientific mistrust of the Bible began with the Enlightenment belief that miracles cannot be reconciled to a
modern, rational view of the world. Armed with this presupposition, scholars turned to the Bible and said, "The Biblical accounts can't be reliable because they contain descriptions of miracles." The premise behind
such a claim is "Science has proven that there is no such thing as miracles."2 But embedded in such a statement is a leap of faith.

It is one thing to say that science is only equipped to test for natural causes and cannot speak to any others. It is quite another to insist that science proves that no other causes could possibly exist. John
Macquarrie writes: "Science proceeds on the assumption that whatever events occur in the world can be accounted for in terms of other events...just as immanent and this-worldly. [So]...Miracle is irreconcilable
with our modern understanding of both science and history."4

Macquarrie is quite right to assert that, when studying a phenomenon, the scientist must always assume there is a natural cause. That is because natural causes are the only kind its methodology can address. It
is another thing to insist that science has proven there can't be any other kind. There would be no experimental model for testing the statement: "No supernatural cause for any natural phenomenon is possible." It
is therefore a philosophical presupposition and not a scientific finding. Macquarrie's argument is ultimately circular. He says that science, by its nature, can't discern or test for supernatural causes, and therefore,
those causes can't exist.

The philosopher Alvin Plantinga responds:
> Macquarrie perhaps means to suggest that the very practice of science requires that one reject the idea (e.g.) of God raising someone from the dead.... [This] argument... is like the drunk who insisted on
looking for his lost car keys only under the streetlight on the grounds that the light was better there. In fact, it would go the drunk one better: it would insist that because the keys would be hard to find in
the dark, they must be under the light.

The other hidden premise in the statement "miracles cannot happen" is "there can't be a God who does miracles." If there is a Creator God, there is nothing illogical at all about the possibility of miracles. After
all, if he created everything out of nothing, it would hardly be a problem for him to rearrange parts of it as and when he wishes. To be sure that miracles cannot occur you would have to be sure beyond a doubt that
God didn't exist, and that is an article of faith. The existence of God can be neither demonstrably proven or disproven.

Isn't Science in Conflict with Christianity?

It is common to believe today that there is a war going on between science and religion. One of the reasons for this perception is that the media needs to report news events as stories with protagonists and
antagonists. It gives wide publicity to battles between secular and religious people over the teaching of evolution in schools, stem-cell research, in vitro fertilization, and many other areas of medicine and science.
These battles give credibility to the claims of Dawkins, Harris, and others that it is either-or-you can be either scientific and rational or religious.

Over the years at Redeemer I've talked to many people trained in science and biology who were very wary of orthodox Christian belief. One young medical student said to me, "The Bible denies evolution, which
most educated people accept. It bothers me terribly that so many Christians, because of their belief in the Bible, can take such an unscientific mind-set." His concern is quite understandable. Here's how I responded
to him.

Evolutionary science assumes that more complex life-forms evolved from less complex forms through a process of natural selection. Many Christians believe that God brought about life this way. For example,
the Catholic church, the largest church in the world, has made official pronouncements supporting evolution as being compatible with Christian belief. However, Christians may believe in evolution as a process
without believing in "philosophical naturalism"-the view that everything has a natural cause and that organic life is solely the product of random forces guided by no one. When evolution is turned into an All-
encompassing Theory explaining absolutely everything we believe, feel, and do as the product of natural selection, then we are not in the arena of science, but of philosophy. Evolution as an All-encompassing
Theory has insurmountable difficulties as a worldview. We will look at these difficulties in Chapter 9.

Dawkins argues that if you believe in evolution as a biological mechanism you must also believe in philosophical naturalism. But why? The same year that Dawkins's The God Delusion was published, Francis
Collins published The Language of God. Collins is an eminent research scientist and head of the Human Genome Project. He believes in evolutionary science and critiques the Intelligent Design movement that denies
the transmutation of species. However, Collins believes that the fine-tuning, beauty, and order of nature nonetheless point to a divine Creator, and describes his conversion from atheism to Christianity. Here then
is what Dawkins says can't exist, someone with a firm belief in evolution as biological mechanism, but who completely rejects philosophical naturalism. Collins, of course, is not alone.Z

Contrary to Dawkins's simplistic schema, there are many different models proposed about how God relates to the development of the life-forms we see today. Ian Barbour lays out four different ways that science
and religion may be related to each other: conflict, dialogue, integration, and independence. At the one end of the spectrum, in "conflict," are both the proponents of "creation science" and, ironically, thinkers
like Dawkins. Each side has bought in to the warfare model of the relationship of science to faith. Many creationists' view of Genesis 1 makes any kind of evolutionary process impossible, while the philosophical
naturalism of Dawkins makes religious belief totally invalid. At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who believe faith is mainly a private, subjective thing and therefore does not speak to the empirical
realm at all. In this view science and religion have nothing to say to each other at all. Barbour himself thinks this view gives away too much, and prefers the spectrum of more moderate and complicated approaches
in which science and religious faith recognize their respective spheres of authority.

It is the conflict model, however, that gets the most publicity. Fortunately, this view is losing credibility with a growing number of scholars. The history of the secularization of American institutions is treated in
an important and influential book edited by Christian Smith.2 In it Smith argues that the conflict model of the relationship of science to religion was a deliberate exaggeration used by both scientists and educational
leaders at the end of the nineteenth century to undermine the church's control of their institutions and increase their own cultural power.10 The absolute warfare model of science and reason was the product not
so much of intellectual necessity but rather of a particular cultural strategy. Many scientists see no incompatibility between faith in God and their work.

Two famous studies that support this contention were done in 1916 and 1997. The American psychologist James Leuba conducted the first survey of scientists, asking them if they believed in a God who actively
communicates with humanity, at least through prayer. Forty percent said they did, 40 percent said they did not, and 20 percent were not sure. In 1997, Edward Larson and Larry Witham repeated this survey asking
the very same questions of scientists. They reported in the scientific journal Nature that they had found that the numbers had not changed significantly in eighty years.11

What, then, of Dawkins's claim that nearly all prominent scientists disbelieve in God? In The God Delusion he cites Larson and Witham's follow-up correspondence in Nature a year later. There they noted that
when they asked the same questions about belief in God to members of the National Academy of Sciences only 7 percent said "yes."12 Dawkins cites this statistic as evidence that intelligent scientific thinking almost
always leads to the conclusion that God does not exist. There are, however, major problems with the way Dawkins, and even Larson and Witham, interpret the data from these studies.

First, keep in mind the original question posed to the scientists in both surveys. Scientists are asked if they believe in a God who personally communicates with humanity. To hold that a transcendent God
created the universe is not enough to be listed as a "believer." Any NAS scientist who believes in a God who does not communicate directly with humanity is automatically put into the category of disbeliever. The
surveys were only designed to “see” scientists with conservative, traditional belief. Those with a more general belief in God are screened out by the way the question is formulated. Second, Dawkins reads the data
as establishing a causal relationship between the scientific mind and atheism. His assumption is that NAS scientists disbelieve because they are scientifically minded. However, the study does not and cannot prove
what the cause of NAS scientists' disbelief in God really is. Alister McGrath, a theologian with an Oxford doctorate in biophysics, writes that most of the many unbelieving scientists he knows are atheists on other
grounds than their science. Many complex factors lead a person to belief or disbelief in God. Some are personal experiences, some are intellectual, and some are social. Sociologists of knowledge like Peter Berger have
shown that our peer group and primary relationships shape our beliefs much more than we want to admit. Scientists, like non-scientists, are very effected by the beliefs and attitudes of the people from whom they
want respect. In McGrath's experience, most of his atheist colleagues brought their assumptions about God to their science rather than basing them on their science.13

Also, Dawkins gives readers the impression that all atheistic scientists would agree with him that no rational, scientific mind could believe in God. But that is simply not the case. Stephen Jay Gould, the late
Harvard scientist and evolutionist who was himself an atheist, knew all about these studies, but could not conclude with Dawkins that science necessarily clashed with Christian faith. He wrote:
Either half my colleagues are enormously stupid, or else the science of Darwinism is fully compatible with conventional religious beliefs and equally compatible with atheism.14

When Gould spoke of "half his colleagues," he was probably not thinking strictly of survey data. He simply knew that a great number of his most respected scientific colleagues had traditional religious beliefs
about God. One of the reasons Gould does not agree with Dawkins is that he was much more willing to concede that science might not be able to account for everything about human existence to every thinker's
satisfaction.

Another scholar who makes this point is the philosopher Thomas Nagel, who critiqued Dawkins's approach in a review of The God Delusion in the journal The New Republic. Nagel, too, is an atheist, but thinks
Dawkins is wrong to insist that, if we are going to be scientific at all, we must embrace "physicalist naturalism...that the ultimate explanation of everything must lie in particle physics, string theory, or whatever
purely extensional laws govern the elements of which the material world is composed." He asks, for example, whether we really believe that our moral intuitions, such as that genocide is morally wrong, are not real
but only the result of neurochemistry hardwired into us. Can physical science do full justice to reality as human beings experience it? Nagel doubts that. He writes:
> The reductionist project usually tries to reclaim some of the originally excluded aspects of the world, by analyzing them in physical—that is, behavioral or neurophysiological terms; but it denies reality
to what cannot be so reduced. I believe the project is doomed that conscious experience, thought, value, and so forth are not illusions, even though they cannot be identified with physical facts.15
This is why even many atheists believe Dawkins is wrong, that science cannot explain everything, and why scientific thought can be compatible with religious belief.

Even though the concept of warfare between science and religion still has much popular credence, we should disabuse ourselves of the notion that we have to choose between the two, or that if you want to be
a Christian you will have to be in conflict with science. A majority of scientists consider themselves deeply or moderately religious-and those numbers have increased in recent decades.16 There is no necessary
disjunction between science and devout faith.

## Doesn't Evolution Disprove the Bible?
What about the more specific issue of how evolutionary science fits with the Biblical account of creation in Genesis 1 and 2? Surely there we have a head-on collision. No, that's not the case.

Different Christian thinkers use all of Barbour's models of relating science to faith-conflict, dialogue, integration, and independence. Some Christians in the highly publicized Creation Science movement take
the conflict model and insist that Genesis 1 teaches that God created all life-forms in a period of six twenty-four-hour days just several thousand years ago. At the other end of the spectrum are Christians who take
the independence model and simply say that God was the primary cause in beginning the world and after that natural causes took over. Other thinkers occupy the central positions. Some hold that God created life
and then guided natural selection to develop all complex life-forms from simpler ones. In this view, God acts as a top-down cause without violating the process of evolution. Others, believing there are gaps in the
fossil record and claiming that species seem to "appear" rather than develop from simpler forms, believe that God performed large-scale creative acts at different points over longer periods of time.
The relationship of science to the Bible hinges not only on how we read the scientific record but how we interpret certain key Biblical passages, such as Genesis 1. Christians who accept the Bible's authority
agree that the primary goal of Biblical interpretation is to discover the Biblical author's original meaning as he sought to be understood by his audience. This has always meant interpreting a text according to its
literary genre. For example, when Christians read the Psalms they read it as poetry. When they read Luke, which claims to be an eyewitness account (see Luke 1:1-4), they take it as history. Any reader can see that
the historical narrative should be read as history and that the poetic imagery is to be read as metaphorical.

The difficulty comes in the few places in the Bible where the genre is not easily identifiable, and we aren't completely sure how the author expects it to be read. Genesis 1 is a passage whose interpretation is
up for debate among Christians, even those with a "high" view of inspired Scripture.17 I personally take the view that Genesis 1 and 2 relate to each other the way Judges 4 and 5 and Exodus 14 and 15 do. In each
couplet one chapter describes a historical event and the other is a song or poem about the theological meaning of the event. When reading Judges 4 it is obvious that it is a sober recounting of what happened in the
battle, but when we read Judges 5, Deborah's Song about the battle, the language is poetic and metaphorical. When Deborah sings that the stars in the heavens came down to fight for the Israelites, we understand
that she means that metaphorically. I think Genesis 1 has the earmarks of poetry and is therefore a “song" about the wonder and meaning of God's creation. Genesis 2 is an account of how it happened. There will
always be debates about how to interpret some passages-including Genesis 1. But it is false logic to argue that if one part of Scripture can't be taken literally then none of it can be. That isn't true of any human
communication.

What can we conclude? Since Christian believers occupy different positions on both the meaning of Genesis 1 and on the nature of evolution, those who are considering Christianity as a whole should not allow
themselves to be distracted by this intramural debate. The skeptical inquirer does not need to accept any one of these positions in order to embrace the Christian faith. Rather, he or she should concentrate on and
weigh the central claims of Christianity. Only after drawing conclusions about the person of Christ, the resurrection, and the central tenets of the Christian message should one think through the various options
with regard to creation and evolution.

Representatives of these different views often imply that their approach is the One True Christian Position on Evolution. Indeed, I'm sure that many reading this will be irritated that I don't take time here to
adjudicate between the competing views. For the record I think God guided some kind of process of natural selection, and yet I reject the concept of evolution as All-encompassing Theory. One commentator on
Genesis captures this balance well:
> If "evolution" is...elevated to the status of a world-view of the way things are, then there is direct conflict with biblical faith. But if "evolution" remains at the level of scientific biological hypothesis, it
would seem that there is little reason for conflict between the implications of Christian belief in the Creator and the scientific explorations of the way which—at the level of biology-God has gone about
his creating processes, 12

## Healing the World
I don't want to be too hard on people who struggle with the idea of God's intervention in the natural order. Miracles are hard to believe in, and they should be. In Matthew 28 we are told that the apostles met the
risen Jesus on a mountainside in Galilee. "When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted" (verse 17). That is a remarkable admission. Here is the author of an early Christian document telling us that
some of the founders of Christianity couldn't believe the miracle of the resurrection, even when they were looking straight at him with their eyes and touching him with their hands. There is no other reason for
this to be in the account unless it really happened.

The passage shows us several things. It is a warning not to think that only we modern, scientific people have to struggle with the idea of the miraculous, while ancient, more primitive people did not. The apostles
responded like any group of modern people-some believed their eyes and some didn't. It is also an encouragement to patience. All the apostles ended up as great leaders in the church, but some had a lot more
trouble believing than others.

The most instructive thing about this text is, however, what it says about the purpose of Biblical miracles. They lead not simply to cognitive belief, but to worship, to awe and wonder. Jesus's miracles in particular
were never magic tricks, designed only to impress and coerce. You never see him say something like: "See that tree over there? Watch me make it burst into flames!" Instead, he used miraculous power to heal the
sick, feed the hungry, and raise the dead. Why? We modern people think of miracles as the suspension of the natural order, but Jesus meant them to be the restoration of the natural order. The Bible tells us that God
did not originally make the world to have disease, hunger, and death in it. Jesus has come to redeem where it is wrong and heal the world where it is broken. His miracles are not just proofs that he has power but
also wonderful foretastes of what he is going to do with that power. Jesus's miracles are not just a challenge to our minds, but a promise to our hearts, that the world we all want is coming.
