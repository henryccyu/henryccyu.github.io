# INTERMISSION
> Come, let us argue it out. -Isaiah 1:18

INTERMISSION means literally to be between journeys or missions. That is where we are now. Underlying all doubts about Christianity are alternate beliefs, unprovable assumptions about the nature of things.
So far I've examined the beliefs beneath the seven biggest objections or doubts people in our culture have about the Christian faith. I respect much of the reasoning behind them, but in the end I don't believe any of
them make the truth of Christianity impossible or even improbable. We have another journey to take, however. It is one thing to argue that there are no sufficient reasons for disbelieving Christianity. It is another
to argue that there are sufficient reasons for believing it. That is what I will try to do in the last part of this volume.

"Wait," someone should ask. "You are going to give us sufficient grounds for believing Christianity? How do you define Christianity? And how do you define 'sufficient"?" Let's take these questions in order.

Which Christianity?

From the outside the various Christian churches and traditions can look extremely different, almost like distinct religions. This is partially because the public worship services look so different. It is also because, as I
said in Chapter 3, Christianity is the faith that is most spread across the cultures and regions of the world. Therefore it has assumed an enormous number of different cultural forms. Another reason that Christians
look so different from one another is the great theological rifts that have occurred over the centuries. The first great division was between the eastern Greek and western Roman church in the eleventh century.
Today these are known as the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. The second great schism was within the Western church, between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.

All Christians who take truth and doctrine seriously will agree that these differences between churches are highly significant. They make a major difference in how one's faith is held and practiced. Nevertheless,
all Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant Christians assent together to the great creeds of the first thousand years of church history, such as the Apostle's, Nicene, Chalcedonian, and Athanasian creeds. In these creeds
the fundamental Christian view of reality is laid out. There is the classical expression of the Christian understanding of God as three-in-one. Belief in the Trinity creates a profoundly different view of the world
from that of polytheists, non-Trinitarian monotheists, and atheists, as I will show in Chapter 13. There is also a strong statement of the full deity and humanity of Jesus Christ in these creeds. Christians, therefore,
do not look upon Jesus as one more teacher or prophet, but as Savior of the world. These teachings make Christians far more like than unlike one another.

What is Christianity? For our purposes, I'll define Christianity as the body of believers who assent to these great ecumenical creeds. They believe that the triune God created the world, that humanity has fallen
into sin and evil, that God has returned to rescue us in Jesus Christ, that in his death and resurrection Jesus accomplished our salvation for us so we can be received by grace, that he established the church, his
people, as the vehicle through which he continues his mission of rescue, reconciliation, and salvation, and that at the end of time Jesus will return to renew the heavens and the earth, removing all evil, injustice,
sin, and death from the world.

All Christians believe all this--but no Christians believe just this. As soon as you ask "How does the church act as vehicle for Jesus's work in the world?" and "How does Jesus's death accomplish our salvation?"
and "How are we received by grace?" Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant Christians will give you different answers. Despite the claims of many to be such, there are no truly "generic" nondenominational Christians.
Everyone has to answer these "how" questions in order to live a Christian life, and those answers immediately put you into one tradition and denomination or another.

It is important for readers to understand this. I am making a case in this book for the truth of Christianity in general-not for one particular strand of it. Some sharp-eyed Presbyterian readers will notice
that I am staying quiet about some of my particular theological beliefs in the interest of doing everything I can to represent all Christians. Yet when I come to describe the Christian gospel of sin and grace, I will
necessarily be doing it as a Protestant Christian, and I won't be sounding notes that a Catholic author would sound.

Which Rationality?

I want to show that there are sufficient reasons for believing Christianity. Prominent disbelievers in Christianity today Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens-insist that
sufficient reasons do not exist for the existence of God. Dawkins, for example, says that the claim of God's existence is a scientific hypothesis that should be open to rational demonstration. He and his co-skeptics
want a logical or empirical argument for God that is airtight and therefore convinces almost everyone. They won't believe in God until they get it.

Is there anything wrong with that? I think so. These authors are evaluating Christian arguments by what some have called "strong rationalism."2 Its proponents laid down what was called the "verification
principle," namely, that no one should believe a proposition unless it can be proved rationally by logic or empirically by sense experience.2 What is meant by the word "proved"? Proof, in this view, is an argument
so strong that no person whose logical faculties are operating properly would have any reason for disbelieving it. Atheists and agnostics ask for this kind of "proof" for God, but are not alone in holding to strong
rationalism. Many Christians claim that their arguments for faith are so strong that all who reject them are simply closing their minds to the truth out of fear or stubbornness.4

Despite all the books calling Christians to provide proofs for their beliefs, you won't see philosophers doing so, not even the most atheistic. The great majority think that strong rationalism is nearly impossible
to defend. To begin with, it can't live up to its own standards. How could you empirically prove that no one should believe something without empirical proof? You can't, and that reveals it to be, ultimately, a
belief. Strong rationalism also assumes that it is possible to achieve "the view from nowhere," a position of almost complete objectivity, but virtually all philosophers today agree that is impossible. We come to
every individual evaluation with all sorts of experiences and background beliefs that strongly influence our thinking and the way our reason works. It is not fair, then, to demand an argument that all rational
people would have to bow to.

The philosopher Thomas Nagel is an atheist, but in his book The Last Word he admits that he can't come to the question of God in anything like a detached way. He confesses that he has "fear of religion," and he
doubts that anyone can address this issue without very powerful motives for seeing the arguments go one way or the other.

I am talking of...the fear of religion itself. I speak from experience, being strongly subject to this fear myself: I want atheism to be true.... It isn't just that I don't believe in God and, naturally, hope that
I'm right in my belief. It's that I hope there is no God! I don't want there to be a God: I don't want the universe to be like that.... I am curious whether there is anyone who is genuinely indifferent as to
whether there is a God—anyone who, whatever his actual belief about the matter, doesn't particularly want either one of the answers to be correct.Z

Imagine a judge who comes to a case in which one of the parties is a company in which she has a heavy financial investment. Because she has a deep desire to see the case go in a particular way, she will recuse
herself from sitting in judgment on the case. Nagel is saying that when it comes to God, we are all like the judge. Depending on our experiences with religion, on our other beliefs and commitments, and on how we
are living our lives we all are deeply interested in seeing the case for God go one way or the other. The trouble is, we can't recuse ourselves. Because he rejects strong rationalism, Nagel has, despite his skepticism,
wonderful respect toward belief and religion. He differs markedly from the tone and stance of writers like Dawkins and Harris.

The philosophical indefensibility of "strong rationalism" is the reason that the books by Dawkins and Dennett have been getting such surprisingly rough treatment in scholarly journals. As just one example,
the Marxist scholar Terry Eagleton wrote a scathing review of Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion in the London Review of Books. Eagleton attacks both of Dawkins's naive ideas, namely that faith has no rational
component, and that reason isn't based to a great degree on faith.

Dawkins considers that all faith is blind faith, and that Christian and Muslim children are brought up to believe unquestioningly. Not even the dim-witted clerics who knocked me about at grammar
school thought that. For mainstream Christianity, reason, argument and honest doubt have always played an integral role in belief.... Reason, to be sure, doesn't go all the way down for believers, but it
doesn't for most sensitive, civilized non-religious types either. Even Richard Dawkins lives more by faith than by reason. We hold many beliefs that have no unimpeachably rational justification, but are
nonetheless reasonable to entertain....

If we reject strong rationalism, are we then stuck in relativism-without any way to judge one set of beliefs from another? Not at all. In Chapters 2 and 3 I argued that complete relativism is impossible to
maintain.2 The approach I will take in the rest of this volume is called “critical rationality."10 It assumes that there are some arguments that many or even most rational people will find convincing, even though
there is no argument that will be persuasive to everyone regardless of viewpoint. It assumes that some systems of belief are more reasonable than others, but that all arguments are rationally avoidable in the end.
That is, you can always find reason to escape it that is not sheer bias or stubbornness. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean that we can't evaluate beliefs, only that we should not expect conclusive proof, and to demand
it is unfair. Not even scientists proceed that way.

Scientists are very reluctant to ever say that a theory is "proved." Even Richard Dawkins admits that Darwin's theory cannot be finally proven, that "new facts may come to light which will force our successors...
to abandon Darwinism or modify it beyond recognition." But that doesn't mean that science cannot test theories and find some far more empirically verifiable than others. A theory is considered empirically
verified if it organizes the evidence and explains phenomena better than any conceivable alternative theory. That is, if, through testing, it leads us to expect with accuracy many and varied events better than any
other rival account of the same data, then it is accepted, though not (in the strong rationalist sense) "proved."

In Is There a God? Oxford philosopher Richard Swinburne argues powerfully that belief in God can be tested and justified (but not proven) in the same way.12 The view that there is a God, he says, leads us to expect
the things we observe that there is a universe at all, that scientific laws operate within it, that it contains human beings with consciousness and with an indelible moral sense. The theory that there is no God, he
argues, does not lead us to expect any of these things. Therefore, belief in God offers a better empirical fit, it explains and accounts for what we see better than the alternative account of things. No view of God can
be proven, but that does not mean that we cannot sift and weigh the grounds for various religious beliefs and find that some or even one is the most reasonable.

God the Playwright

I don't want anyone to think that I am adopting "critical rationality" as some sort of second best, however. If the God of the Bible really does exist, "critical rationality" would be exactly the way we ought to approach
the question of his being and existence.

When a Russian cosmonaut returned from space and reported that he had not found God, C. S. Lewis responded that this was like Hamlet going into the attic of his castle looking for Shakespeare. If there is a
God, he wouldn't be another object in the universe that could be put in a lab and analyzed with empirical methods. He would relate to us the way a playwright relates to the characters in his play. We (characters)
might be able to know quite a lot about the playwright, but only to the degree the author chooses to put information about himself in the play. Therefore, in no case could we "prove" God's existence as if he were an
object wholly within our universe like oxygen and hydrogen or an island in the Pacific.

Lewis gives us another metaphor for knowing the truth about God when he writes that he believes in God "as I believe the sun has risen, not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else."13 Imagine
trying to look directly at the sun in order to learn about it. You can't do it. It will burn out your retinas, ruining your capacity to take it in. A far better way to learn about the existence, power, and quality of the sun
is to look at the world it shows you, to recognize how it sustains everything you see and enables you to see it.

Here, then, we have a way forward. We should not try to "look into the sun," as it were, demanding irrefutable proofs for God. Instead we should "look at what the sun shows us." Which account of the world has
the most "explanatory power" to make sense of what we see in the world and in ourselves? We have a sense that the world is not the way it ought to be. We have a sense that we are very flawed and yet very great.
We have a longing for love and beauty that nothing in this world can fulfill. We have a deep need to know meaning and purpose. Which worldview best accounts for these things?

Christians do not claim that their faith gives them omniscience or absolute knowledge of reality. Only God has that. But they believe that the Christian account of things-creation, fall, redemption, and
restoration makes the most sense of the world. I ask you to put on Christianity like a pair of spectacles and look at the world with it. See what power it has to explain what we know and see.

If the God of the Bible exists, he is not a man in the attic, but the Playwright. That means we won't be able to find him like we would find a passive object with the powers of empirical investigation. Rather, we
must find the clues to his reality that he has written into the universe, including into us. That is why, if God exists, we would expect to find that he appeals to our rational faculties. If we were made "in his image" as
rational, personal beings, there should be some resonance between his mind and ours. It also means that reason alone won't be enough. The Playwright can only be known through personal revelation. That is why
we have to take a look at what the Bible says about God and the human condition.

In the Christian view, however, the ultimate evidence for the existence of God is Jesus Christ himself. If there is a God, we characters in his play have to hope that he put some information about himself in the
play. But Christians believe he did more than give us information. He wrote himself into the play as the main character in history, when Jesus was born in a manger and rose from the dead. He is the one with whom
we have to do.
