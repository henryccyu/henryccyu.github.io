## SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE -- Chapter 1
# Passive, Aggressive,and Assertive   

"That may be the biggest Christmas tree I've ever seen!"  
Hank Mason, head of the Property Maintenance Committee, stood admiring the 20-foot evergreen and allowed himself to bask for a moment in his excitement and satisfaction. "I'm glad we decided to have one big tree instead of two smaller ones," he added.  
Tom Warren, one of the committee members who was spending his Saturday morning helping set up the huge tree in the chancel, looked at the tree with some misgivings.   
"It sure does look nice," Tom said loudly enough for everyone to hear, then added in a somewhat uncertain tone, I only hope the tree stand is sturdy enough to hold it."   
Tom waited, hoping that Hank would ask him about his concerns. Having been in charge of putting up Christmas trees at his previous congregation for the past six years, Tom knew all about the hazards of large, unstable Christmas trees. From experience, he had already learned that a tree that size needed guy wires to make sure it didn't fall. People could even be injured if such a large, unstable tree fell. But this was Tom's first Christmas at the new church, and he didn't want people to think he was some pushy know-it-all. He hoped Hank would pick up on his "hint."   
Hank picked up on the hint all right, but not in the way Tom intended. Shrugging off Tom's remark with a look of disdain, Hank exclaimed, "Don't be silly! That tree stand is sturdy enough to hold a tree twice that size."   
"We might need guy wires," Tom ventured hesitantly.  
"Guy wires!" Hank said with a smirk. "Take it easy. Some people always think something awful is going to happen. Let's just get this tree up. I've got other things to do today."   
Tom felt the blood rushing to his face, an obvious confirmation of the anger and embarrassment he felt inside. Tom looked away for a moment, hoping Hank and the others hadn't noticed his discomfort at Hank's remarks. Tom had enough trouble handling put-downs outside of church Getting hit with one in the middle of the sanctuary, though, somehow made it seem even worse.  
At that moment Fred, another helper, volunteered to get the boxes of decorations from the storage shed. "Want to help, Tom?"   
"Sure," said Tom, glad for an excuse to leave.   
Tom and Fred walked toward the storage building. Tom, don't feel bad about what Hank said. I don't think he realizes how he sounds."   
Tom shrugged it off. "Oh, it's okay. No harm done."  
But it wasn't okay, and deep inside Tom felt a twinge of guilt. He'd just told Fred a lie to cover up how he felt.   

### Passive Behavior   

  Although Tom Warren sometimes behaves assertively or even aggressively, his preferred style of dealing with people is passive. The word passive means "not resisting" or "not acting." Originally, the word passive was derived from a Latin word meaning "to suffer," which is an accurate description of what often results from passive behavior.   
  Passive behavior is behavior that moves against the self. Passive behavior says, "I'll give up anything to avoid displeasure and to gain approval." Passive people frequently give up important parts of their own personalities to avoid disapproval or criticism so o will like them.  
  Certainly Tom Warren suffered that Saturday morning as he helped put up the Christmas tree. Tom's behavior was behavior that moved against himself, because he had knowledge and experience he wanted to offer, yet he behaved pas16 sively. He merely hinted at what he knew by his vague comment: "I only hope the tree stand is sturdy enough to hold it." Afraid people would think he was a pushy know it-all, he resorted to hinting, even when the safety of the congregation was at stake. This bothered Tom's conscience.  
  Tom also suffered in the face of Hank's "Don't be silly" put-down. By not standing up for himself, Tom suffered the injustice and humiliation of Hank's attack.  
  His body told him that all was not well by increasing the blood flow to his face. His face turned red, and he felt physically uncomfortable.  
  Tom again behaved passively when he left the church to help Fred. Tom left Hank to supervise, relinquishing his opportunity to share his knowledge and contribute to the overall safety and success of the project.  
  Tom moved against himself once more when he told Fred, "It's okay. No harm done." That wasn't true, and Tom again damaged his integrity and compromised his sincerity by not being honest about how he felt. Tom suffered because he moved against himself as he tried to manage public opin ion about himself and to hide his feelings.  
  Passivity may show itself physically or verbally. Tom's passivity was both.  

Physical Passivity   

Physical passivity is marked by a person's withdrawal from a situation. An individual may walk out, leave theroom, sleep too much, or withdraw by using alcoholor other drugs. Another way to be physically passive is to receive physical abuse without defense or protest.  

Verbal Passivity   

A verbally passive person "keeps quiet." If you're pas sive in your communications, you withhold feedback.  

Consider for a moment the importance of feedback. It would be very difficult, for example, to function without feedback from your environment. When you walk, certain muscles in your legs send information to the brain about the effects of your leg movements. Because you have feedback from different muscles about how far your leg has moved and where your leg is presently, you can take another step. Your muscles have communicated with your brain, and your brain has communicated with your muscles. Without this exchange of communication, you couldn't walk. You would collapse.  

In the same way, when you withhold feedback in a personal relationship, you risk the collapse of that relationship. If you withhold needed information when you communicate, you create an atmosphere of uncertainty. The other person never really knows what you think or feel. He or she is left to assume what you're thinking and feeling, and assumptions can lead to disastrous misunderstandings and strained relationships.   

Verbal passivity also involves such behaviors as pretending to remember someone's name, lying, hinting, pretending to understand, or falsely saying, "That's okay." Christians are often tempted to say "I forgive you" prematurely, just to avoid the painful process of acknowledging and working through a sin and its consequences. It may take a long, painful time for the other to come to genuine repentance.   

Living in a predominately passive style is much like living out a lifelong game of "Mother, May I?" In "Mother, May I?" you can't make a move without the permission of the person who is "Mother." Similarly, when people adopt a passive style, they're constantly alert to the potential displeasure and disapproval of others and will fine-tune their lives and activities in order to gain the permission and approval of those they deem powerful.  

Aggressive Behavior   
Aggressive behavior is behavior that moves against others. Aggressive behavior says, "I have the right to patronize you, put you down, dominate you, or humiliate you in order to get what I want." The aggressive person has few internal restraints and recognizes few external limits.   

Hank Mason behaved aggressively in his dealings with Tom. Specifically, his behavior moved against Tom when he said, "Don't be silly," dismissing Tom's concern. Granted, it isn't Hank's responsibility to chase down every hint Tom throws into the conversational arena, but some sensitivity to Tom's misgivings and a well-placed question or two might have shifted the focus from Hank's need to be in charge to a discussion of Tom's experience and suggestions.  

Hank's behavior also moved against others because his refusal to entertain Tom's misgivings actually put the congregation in danger. Having never erected a 20-foot tree before, Hank wasn't aware of what he didn't know. Neither was he receptive to the doubts of others. By moving against Tom, Hank also moved against the safety and best interest of the congregation.  

Aggression may be physical, nonverbal, or verbal, or it may surface as passive aggression.  

Physical Aggression   

You are all too familiar with physical acts of aggression from reading daily news reports of abused spouses, children, and older people. You hear of murders, assaults, driveby shootings, and gang warfare. You doubtlessly know more an you want to know about physical aggression   

Nonverbal Aggression   

Nonverbal aggression is familiar to anyone who knows the phrase "If looks could kill." Many aggressive communications take place without words. Individuals move against others simply by facial expression, by their gestures, or by their tone of voice. Consider how someone feels attacked when he or she says something and another responds with a sneer or a look of scorn. Hank's smirk was an instance of nonverbal aggression. Sometimes people shake their heads in disbelief or utter a disgusted snort, a barely audible "humph," or an exasperated, exaggerated sigh to show that they think what a person has just said is so not worth considering. People use these aggressive behaviors to move against others, trying to establish superiority over them.   

Verbal Aggression   

Most aggressive acts are verbal rather than physical, and many social situations are war zones where words are weapons. Verbal aggression takes several form:   

Insults. The word insult comes from a Latin word meaning "to leap upon." Some people verbally "leap upon" others, with words or by the tone of their voices. Sometimes people use taunts that are hartful not because of the actual meaning of the words, but because the intended meaning is the opposite of the spoken meaning: "Of course it is," they say in a condescending, sarcastic tone, implying, "Of course it isn't, you dummy."   

Put-downs. The term put-down is a fitting description of verbal aggression. People use put-downs to place another in an inferior position by calling attention to faults or mistakes or by telling others something unflattering about the person while the person is present. A put-down is used to humiliate or demean another person.   

Profanity. Profanity often accompanies put-downs and other aggressive behaviors. Most people have become accustomed to hearing profanity and seldom think about what it means and how it affects interpersonal relations. Profanity almost automatically transforms what is said into aggressive communication. Consider the difference between these two statements made by a tired father to his son:   

"Would you please move your arm out of the way. I can't see the football game," or "Damn it, get your arm out of the way. I can't see."   

The usual excuse is that profanity supplies emphasis or forcefulness, and that's true. People often use profanity when they want to forcefully make their point, to help them manipulate or dominate an encounter. It's a "you'd-better-listen-to-this" communication.  
Blaming. The word blame originates in an old French word meaning "to speak evil of," and that's essentially what someone does when he or she places blame on another. Frequently, the root of blame is applying one's own personal "shoulds" or "oughts" to others. Others should do thus-and-so. Others ought to think so-and-so. And if they don't let me live their lives for them, then what happens is their fault. Blame usually escalates aggression. Certainly instances arise in which one person is truly to blame for a problem, but in most conflicts both people have contributed to the problem.   
Sarcasm. The word sarcasm in its Greek roots means "flesh tearing." Anyone who has felt the pain of a sarcastic remark will appreciate that apt description. Sarcasm tears psychological flesh. Sarcasm is always aggressive, and it almost always hurts much more than the physical pain of a slap or a cut. Sarcastic comments from your childhood made by a teacher, a parent, or a classmate may still hurt when you recall them today.  
  With all these ways to be verbally aggressive, it's no wonder that James wrote to the early Christians:   
  How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire! And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is placed among our members as a world of iniquity; it stains the whole body, sets on fire the cycle of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell. For every species of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species, but no one can tame the tongue -- a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so (James 3:5b-10 NRSV)  

Passive Aggression   

Passive aggression is a subtle kind of aggression, an underhanded way of moving against another person or manipulating others to get one's own way. Those who use passive aggression are sometimes called "powerful passives" because they use undercover means to get their way, to get even, and to express what they're not willing to say in a straightforward manner.   

Passive aggression may take several forms:   
Procrastinating, forgetting, dawdling. This kind of passive aggression looks a lot like a sit-down strike because in both instances people are attempting to get their way by inactivity. Despite promises and assurances that they'll do their best, they hold back and actually sabotage the goals and plans of others.   
Pouting. People who pout are like a bean pot -- you know something is cooking because you can see the steam escape! Usually people who pout deny that anything is both ering them. If you ask what's wrong, they answer, "Nothing."   
Silent treatment. Here's a new twist to an old saying:  
    Sticks and stones are hard on bones,  
    Aimed with an angry art.  
    Words can sting like anything,  
    But silence breaks the heart.   

A person who uses the silent treatment is trying to punish the other, trying to inflict pain. This passive-aggressive behavior is often successful because to be shunned and ignored is to have your existence denied; the silent treatment is a way of saying, "You're not even here." Such withholding of love and relationship is painful indeed.  

 Manipulative tears. Those who use tears manipulatively generate them for the express purpose of getting their own way. Manipulative tears are not to be confused with heartfelt tears or tears shed in spite of one's attempt to keep from crying.  

Assertive Behavior   

Assertive behavior is integral and essential to the Christian lifestyle. Assertive behavior is behavior that honors the self while honoring others. The assertive person authentically cares for others and at the same time engages in God-pleasing self-care.   

Assertive behavior is a constructive way of living and relating to other people. It reflects your concern about being honest, direct, open, and natural in your relations with others.   

Assertiveness encompasses a wide variety of actions. For example, assertive behavior may involve standing up for your rights. It may involve genuinely expressing your affection for another person. Assertive behavior may mean giving as well as receiving compliments. And it might involve saying yes to some requests and no to other requests.  

By behaving assertively, people begin to see themselves and others as individuals who are important and who have feelings, ideas, opinions, and rights that are worthy of expression. Assertive behavior can mean expressing all those aspects of self without resorting to threats, hostility, manipulation, or other aggressive actions. And it can mean experiencing those expressions from others without consid ering oneself threatened, abused, intimidated, or victimized.   

Expressions of assertiveness are as individual as eac person. Only Jesus could be 100 percent assertive 100 percent of the time (though at times he chose not to be). For the rest of humanity, some people are more assertive and some people are less so. Most people are more comfortable being assertive in some situations than in others. For example, one person may be very assertive in standing up for her rights before a manipulative door-to-door salesperson, but she may be reluctant to be assertive with a manipulative coworker.   

This kind of personal unevenness characterizes the nor mal learning process, so it's no surprise that it's also true of learning assertion skills. Even though you may understand assertiveness very well and use assertive language and behaviors regularly and enthusiastically, you may still absolutely shock yourself from time to time by responding aggressively or passively out of habit.   

When -- not if -- this happens, be kind to yourself. Give yourself a pat on the back for being able to identify a nonassertive response, and take just a moment to think about what you'll do next time. And then let it go. Inconsistency is a legitimate part of the normal learning curve. You can't develop new patterns without occasionally slipping back into old ones. Concentrate on what you've done well.  

Assertive Attitudes and Behaviors   

These attitudes and behaviors characterize Christians who live assertively.  

Assertive Christians believe they have options. They believe that, because God has given them a free will, they are to exercise that will and critically examine options and opportunities so they can make God-pleasing decisions.  
Assertive Christians are proactive. The word proactive means "to move forward" or "to move ahead of events." An assertive individual is proactive rather than reactive. He or she will enter into situations and propose ideas, offer opin ions, or anticipate needs so as to contribute fully rather than simply react to people or events.   
Assertive Christians believe God values each person. "For God so loved the world.. . ." affirms the assertive Christian Scripture repeatedly reveals a God whose care is personal sacrificial, and focused on each individual.  
Assertive Christians are motivated by love. Having experi enced God's love and saving grace in Jesus, assertive Christians want to live out that love in all their relationships, including their relationship with themselves.   
Assertive Christians stand up for themselves without excessive anxiety. Because their personal value and intrinsic worth depend not on the approval of others but on God's unconditional love and approval, assertive Christians ask others for respect, fair treatment, and honest interactions without excessive anxiety and fearfulness. Assertive Christians participate courageously in personal relationships.  
Assertive Christians are people of integrity. The word integrity means "wholeness," and assertive individuals are people who strive to live out their faith, to integrate what they believe and how they live. For an assertive Christian the outside reveals the inside.  
Assertive Christians accept their own limitations and the limitations of others. There is no perfect world, and Jesus was the only perfect person. We have limits to our time, energy, and abilities. Assertive Christians can live with their limitations and understand that others also have limitations.  
Assertive Christians practice self-revelation within appropriate personal boundaries. Assertive people make decisions about what personal information they want to share with others and what they would prefer to keep to themselves. Assertive individuals then uphold those personal decisions. Assertive Christians can choose to behave assertively, aggressively, or passively. In chapter 4, you'll examine Jesus life and the choices he made. At appropriate times Jesus chose to behave occasionally passively, sometimes aggressively, most often assertively.  
Assertive Christians believe that every person has certain basic human rights. Even though some mistakenly malign personal rights as self-serving and sinful, the assertive Christian discovers human rights throughout Scripture and in Jesus' life. Assertive individuals honor human rights for others and claim them for themselves as well. See appendix B for a partial listing of basic human rights.   

St. Paul Writes to Timid Timothy   

Individuals who think and behave assertively are people who have an active orientation to life, people who participate fully in life, people with a sense of God-given personal power. Assertive men and women live decisively, aware that life is full of choices and sensitive to their responsibility to make decisions about those choices.   

While assertive Christians may not always know immediately which decision they want to make, they move deliberately toward information and people, ask for the time necessary to make a good decision, and feel free to modify or change that decision, should that change be appropriate.  

Paul wrote to the young pastor Timothy: "The Spirit that God has given us does not make us timid; instead, his Spirit fills us with power, love, and self-control" (2 Timothy 1:7 TEV)   

Paul is telling Timothy that the Holy Spirit's presence gives Christians courage in their personal relationships. As the Holy Spirit fills us with power, we all have a growing ability to make careful choices based on our faith and on our personal understanding of God's will for our lives. As the Holy Spirit fills us with God's love, we thank God that we can by God's power behave selflessly, respectfully, and com passionately toward others. And, as the Holy Spirit fills us with self-control, we accept responsibility for our behavior, live a life accountable to God, and approach challenges and life tasks with perseverance.   

With God's Spirit alive in us, we can rise above timidity and be faithful and strong in the Lord. With God's Spirit alive in us, we can be assertive!
