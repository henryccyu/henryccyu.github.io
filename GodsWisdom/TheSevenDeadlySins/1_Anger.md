> Whoever is patient has great understanding, but one who is quick-tempered displays folly.... A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict, but the
one who is patient calms a quarrel.... Fools give full vent to their rage but the wise bring calm in the end.... An angry person stirs up conflict,
and a hot-tempered person commits many sins. (14:29, 15:18, 29:11,22)

**THE DANGER OF ANGER**. These texts give us an extensive list of the dangers of anger. A wise person is patient with people,
seeing extenuating circumstances and legitimate reasons that people misbehave. By contrast, the quick-tempered responds in rage
rather than understanding, reducing everything to a simplistic black-and-white analysis (14:29). Anger creates greater conflict and
destroys the good that cooperation and compromise can bring (15:18). While anger is not a sin in and of itself, it should be a passing
thing, directed without excess to solve a problem, resulting in calm at the end (29:11). In the same way, God's anger is for a moment,
but his favor lasts a lifetime (Psalm 30:5). Remember, uncontrolled anger is a "gateway drug" for many other sins (29:22). No other
sinful emotion has led to so much violence and, literally, to so many dead bodies.

Think of the actions and words you most regret. How many of them were done in anger?

Prayer: Father, I have seen relationships and lives ruined irreparably by anger. Yet denied, pent-up anger can be destructive. I
confess that I deny my anger even to myself. Your anger against me was never wrong, and yet you put it aside through Jesus. Teach
me how to heal my anger through Jesus as well. Amen.

> A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty; rescue them, and you will have to do it again. (19:19)

**ONE'S OWN WORST ENEMY**. The first clause literally says in the Hebrew, that the characteristically angry person "carries around
punishment." This means that no one has to slap some kind of penalty or fine on the angry man or woman. Their loss of temper
always entails natural consequences that they can't escape. For example, it leads the people who see the blowup to not trust the
person as much as they did before.

But we should not imagine that a hot-tempered person is necessarily always someone who is melting down in rage. There is a
kind of Christian who is habitually abrasive, critical, and ungenerous in dealing with people. They are seldom affirming and usually
undiplomatic. They are prone to harsh language and cutting humor and they bristle easily when contradicted. What is behind all this
unattractive behavior? It is an undercurrent of anger, like a hidden underground stream rather than a visible one on the surface that
noisily rushes over stones.

The second clause tells us that people prone to anger are constantly getting themselves into new trouble. They are their own worst
enemies.

How have any of these various forms of anger brought its consequences into your life in the past?

_Prayer_: Lord, I know anger is not always wrong, but it is seldom righteous when it appears in my life. Help me detect where it is
flowing in my life. I will need both your humbling grace and your assuring love if my anger is going to subside. Please supply them.
Amen.

> Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.... The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit; a man who
is under the LORD's wrath falls into it. (11:4, 22:14)

**THE GOODNESS OF ANGER**. God himself is a God of wrath. St. Paul tells us not to sin in our anger (Ephesians 4:26), meaning that there
is a proper place for it. So anger is not itself something bad but very quickly goes bad in us.

Anger is energy released to defend something you love. God is angry toward the evil that dishonors him and ruins that which he
loves. But the problem with human anger is this—we tend to overlove the wrong things. It is not wrong to value your name and
reputation, but if you love them too much, there will be inordinate anger that essentially is just a defending of your ego. Parents may
get inordinately angry at children mainly because the children embarassed them before others. Because our loves are confused and
out of order, our anger-basically a good thing—so often does evil. We need to look to the one whose anger was always guided by love
not for himself but for us (Mark 3:5; John 2:14-17).

Think of the last time you got really angry. What were you defending?

_Prayer_: Lord, it is a sin for me to not get angry at the wrongs done to others. But I don't do that. Instead I get angry when my will is
crossed. Help me learn to get angry at sin, not at sinners at the problems, not the persons. Amen.

> A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. (15:1)

**HELPING THE ANGRY**. The first way to help an angry person is to surround them with nonangry speech. Abrasive words create more
anger. In fact, a single harsh word can be a spark to stir up a blazing fire or rage. The word harsh means painful. When we argue, our
words can have two quite different purposes. We can speak to simply make the truth clear (which may be painful to hear), or we can
speak specifically to inflict pain, to make the other person feel foolish or bad. Of course we tell ourselves and others that the former
motive is what drives us, but usually it is the latter. And one zinger word can destroy a relationship and put up a wall of bitterness
that lasts years or a lifetime.

In contrast, the gentle answer means speaking patiently, tenderly, as affirmatively as possible, and always calmly. One of the best
ways to help an angry person learn patience is to surround him with patient people. A gentle answer must still be truthful (Ephesians
4:15) but filled with evident concern and no ill will.

When was the last time you had an argument? What were your motives? Were your words gentle?

_Prayer_: Lord, when your disciples let you down in your hour of greatest need in Gethsemane, your words were so gentle (Matthew
26:41) and without any rancor. Even when you are stern with me, you overwhelm me with love. Let me be the same with everyone.
Amen.

> Do not say, "I'll pay you back for this wrong!" Wait for the LORD, and he will avenge you. (20:22)

**PERSPECTIVE**. The second way to help the angry person is to give him a new perspective on vengeance. An angry person seeks to pay
someone back for something-done either to him or to someone else. This requires a sense of having the high moral ground; the
angry person tells himself that he would never do what that other person did. He feels that this gives him a warrant to inflict insult
or pain on the other.

Instead, 20:22 tells the angry person that only God occupies high enough moral ground for vengeance. God knows all that was in
the person's heart and what they deserve. You don't. God alone is holy-he alone "would never do what they did❞—and so has the
right to inflict judgment. You don't. God also has the power to do so in the time and manner that might lead them to repentance
(Romans 2:4). You don't. If a true wrong has been done to you, he will avenge you. You don't have to.

Is there someone in your life whom you are having trouble forgiving? Is it because you feel you have the high moral ground?

_Prayer_: Lord, I now see that I cannot stay angry at someone unless I feel superior to them. Why should a saved sinner like me feel
like that? If you paid me back for all I've done to you, where would I be? Help me remember these gospel truths when I'm tempted to
be angry. Amen.

> Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice, or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away
from them. (24:17-18)

**GLOATING**. We have a German word that has come over into English usage schadenfreude. It means to have joy because of someone
else's sorrow or shame. When someone who has opposed our views and beliefs falls into scandal or turns out to be a hypocrite, we
may clap our hands and say, "Ha! That shows I was right." When someone who we feel has done us wrong falls into trouble, we fist-
pump "Yes!" Gloating is nothing but anger waiting for its moment and enjoying it.

But 24:17 tells us we are never to gloat when an opponent falls. And verse 18 shows that verse 17 is not just a suggestion. "Your glee
may well be [in God's sight] a more punishable sin than all the guilt of your enemy. Instead, when your opponent falls, examine
yourself for your own flaws. “So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall” (1 Corinthians 10:12). And look to
the one who did not get his joy out of our sorrow but, through his death on the cross, gave us joy through his sorrow (Isaiah 53:4).

Have you learned of something bad that happened to someone-and found it satisfying to you? Why?

_Prayer_: Lord Jesus, when you prophesied the destruction of the city that would put you to death, there was not a hint of gloating or
pleasure. You just wept for them (Luke 19:41-44). Reproduce this temper of yours in me. Amen.

> Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.... Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent overlook an insult. (10:12, 12:16)

**ANNOYANCE**. Conflict (Hebrew madon) in Proverbs does not refer to principled disagreements or respectful arguments. It is something
God hates (6:19) and at the heart of conflict is annoyance, a word that means contempt and disdain between people. Everything said
in conflict is to belittle rather than convince.

The solution is love (verse 12), and this doesn't primarily mean feelings. Nor does it mean to refrain from correction if it is necessary
(27:5,6). When 10:12 says that love covers wrongs, it does not mean "cover up." Anger tries to expose and strip the other person, to
make them look terrible. Love refuses to pay back and deliberately seeks to put the other person in the best light. It seeks to put their
needs ahead of your own, all in the interest of helping the person change, if possible. Keep in mind that anger is energy released to
defend something you love. When you are in a dispute, stop releasing your anger against the other person in order to defend your ego.
Instead release your energy against the problem (not the person) that is dividing you.

Do you show annoyance in your face-to-face or online speech? If you argue, do you do it to strip or to cover the other person in love?

_Prayer_: Father, you pour out your anger against sin and evil, and you put away your anger through Jesus Christ. I, however, am
constantly annoyed by and disdainful of so many people. Give me a far more gracious spirit that overlooks slights and puts opponents
in the best possible light. Amen.

## May 5
> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give hiin water to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and
the LORD will reward you. (25:21-22)

**LOVING YOUR ENEMY**. The final defeat of inordinate anger is not to merely refrain from payback but to positively love and do good to
people who have wronged you. We are not merely to not curse but to bless (Romans 12:14). We are not merely to refuse to repay evil
with evil (Romans 12:17) but to overcome evil with good (Romans 12:21).

Why is such behavior called burning coals on the head? Our opponents may find our kindness toward them to be painful, as Javert
finds Valjean's forgiveness unbearable in Les Misérables. They want confirmation that their contempt for us is justified, and kind
behavior robs them of it. But our motives are never to make them uncomfortable. Beware of being kind out of a desire to appear "more
noble than thou." That isn't love it's a subtle revenge. Do good to them. They may not want you to do it, but as far as it depends on
you, you are to try (Romans 12:18).

Is there someone whom, while you are not trying to harm them, you are simply staying away from? How could you do good to
them?

_Prayer_: Lord, I confess that this is one of the most radical and hard directives in your Word for me. I congratulate myself that I am
not paying them back-and now you say to do them positive good! Lord, let me start by praying for them. Amen.
