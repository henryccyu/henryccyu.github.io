## April 3
> What the wicked dread will overtake them; what the righteous desire will be granted.... The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires.... Desire without
knowledge is not good-how much more will hasty feet miss the way! (10:24, 11:6, 19:2)  
> 10:24 恶人所怕的必临到他，义人所愿的必蒙应允。  
> 11:6 正直人的公义必拯救自己，但奸诈人必陷溺于自己的恶欲中。（新译本）  
> 19:2 心无知识的乃为不善，脚步急快的难免犯罪。  

**TRAPPED BY DESIRE**. The "heart" is not mere feeling but rather the seat of our deepest trusts and loves (March 26). Today's society, however, identifies our strongest feelings as the "true self"
and insists we express them. But wisdom recognizes that our desires can trap us (11:6). They can also be influenced from outside. Modern consumer capitalism creates the desire to accumulate
material goods that, we think, will give us status and identity. Poor parenting can train children to so desire approval and love that they remain in abusive relationships or become workaholics.

Wise people do not simply accept their desires as they are, nor with hasty feet run to fulfill them. Rather, as Augustine counseled, they reorder their desires with the knowledge of the truth.
The problem of the workaholic, for example, is not that we love work too much, but that we love God too little, relative to our career. What the righteous desire is ultimately God himself, seeing
his face. "I... will see your face... I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness" (Psalm 17:15). Only if we cultivate our relationship to God and grow the desire for him will our other desires not
entrap us.

What loves or desires do you have that are "inordinate," that push God out of the top spot?

> _Prayer_: Lord, I see that I don't really love my job or my comforts or my family too much. I love you too little in proportion to them. Only if I love you supremely will I love everything else well
and properly. Capture my heart! Amen.
