> What the wicked dread will overtake them; what the righteous desire will be granted.... The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires.... Desire without
knowledge is not good-how much more will hasty feet miss the way! (10:24, 11:6, 19:2)  
> 10:24 恶人所怕的必临到他，义人所愿的必蒙应允。  
> 11:6 正直人的公义必拯救自己，但奸诈人必陷溺于自己的恶欲中。（新译本）  
> 19:2 心无知识的乃为不善，脚步急快的难免犯罪。  

**TRAPPED BY DESIRE**. The "heart" is not mere feeling but rather the seat of our deepest trusts and loves (March 26). Today's society, however, identifies our strongest feelings as the "true self"
and insists we express them. But wisdom recognizes that our desires can trap us (11:6). They can also be influenced from outside. Modern consumer capitalism creates the desire to accumulate
material goods that, we think, will give us status and identity. Poor parenting can train children to so desire approval and love that they remain in abusive relationships or become workaholics.

Wise people do not simply accept their desires as they are, nor with hasty feet run to fulfill them. Rather, as Augustine counseled, they reorder their desires with the knowledge of the truth.
The problem of the workaholic, for example, is not that we love work too much, but that we love God too little, relative to our career. What the righteous desire is ultimately God himself, seeing
his face. "I... will see your face... I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness" (Psalm 17:15). Only if we cultivate our relationship to God and grow the desire for him will our other desires not
entrap us.

What loves or desires do you have that are "inordinate," that push God out of the top spot?

> _Prayer_: Lord, I see that I don't really love my job or my comforts or my family too much. I love you too little in proportion to them. Only if I love you supremely will I love everything else well
and properly. Capture my heart! Amen.

> A longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning from evil.... Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. There is surely a future hope for you, and your
hope will not be cut off. (13:19, 23:17-18)

**ORDERING DESIRE**. The soul has an appetite. We are drawn to good things that are satisfying, but nothing besides God himself should be a nonnegotiable necessity for life. Every other
enjoyment comes with the danger that we make it such. "To set your heart on [any good] thing is to weaken the power to assess it. It must be had, at all costs, not now because of its worth but
because you have promised it to yourself."

How, then, can we desire God above all other things? Plato said actions flow from thinking and Aristotle taught that our thinking is shaped by our actions. Proverbs says they are both right.
Contemplate 23:17-18. Use the mind to think—what are the only things that finally last? (There is... a future hope.) Set the heart on God in prayer and worship until you don't just believe but
experience awe and wonder (be zealous... fear) before him. And set the will on obedience. Don't envy (or imitate) sinners. These things will reorder your desires.
How specifically will you implement any of these strategies this week? See the prayer below for one.

> _Prayer_: Lord, I spend far more time asking for various things than in praise and adoration of your greatness. No wonder, then, that I long for the things more than I long for you. How
wonderful that the thing that most honors you will most transform me. I commit myself to giving you that glory every day. Amen.

> Do not envy the wicked, do not desire their company; for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble. (24:1-2)

**THE SOCIOLOGY OF DESIRE**. Sociologists know that we tend to find most plausible the ideas of the people with whom we spend the most time and to whom our admiration is most directed.
If we "sit in the company of mockers" (Psalm 1:1) or of the cruel and violent (verse 2), we will become like them. It is easy to envy mockers and cruel people because they are often successful
through their ruthlessness.

Today we believe that we can create our own identity through our own free choices. We may think we are being "true to ourselves" when we shed the constraints of traditional values and
morality, but in reality we are simply allowing a new community to tell us who we are. "The question of individual identity is always also a question of community, from family and church,
school and business, all the way up to nation and state. Communities create the paths we walk."85

Why do you hang out with the people you do? Have your choices been influenced by a desire to be like the people you spend time with the most?

> _Prayer_: Lord, because I'm too busy to spend sustained time with other believers, I am being shaped by other communities-through social media, news media, and the stream of
advertisements and bulletins that come at me every day. Motivate me to seek friends who believe, and then help me find them. Amen.

> Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is kept safe. (29:25)

**APPROVAL**. The only way to reorder our desires toward God is to identify where our hearts are already committed instead. For the next four days we will look at four typical God substitutes.
The first is human approval. The fear of man is a snare. If we look to human beings more than to God for our worth and value, we will be trapped by anxiety, by an overneed to please, by the
inability to withdraw from exploitative relationships, by the inability to take criticism, and by a cowardice that makes us unable to confront others. Our feelings will be easily hurt and we will
tend to overcommit out of a desire for acceptance.

The devastation that comes from the fear of man has many forms. It includes parents who are afraid to discipline their children and employees who are unable to call out corruption in their
companies. But we must obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29). The only thing that casts out the fear of man is a deep love relationship with God (1 John 4:18). Then we can say, "The Lord is
my helper; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?" (Hebrews 13:6)

Whose approval is functionally more important to you than God's?

> _Prayer_: Lord Jesus, you said that you were the liberator (John 8:36). Now liberate me from my enslavement to the "fear of man." I am far too concerned about what people think of me. If I
have the regard of the King, why should I care about what others say? Never let me forget this. Amen.

> Do not love sleep or you will grow poor; stay awake and you will have food to spare.... Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich. (20:13, 21:17)

**COMFORT**. A second form of inordinate desire is an inordinate love of physical pleasure and comfort. The pleasure described here is the joy that comes from the satisfaction of physical wants.
Wine, of course, heightens spirits while oil was used in cosmetics and indicates beauty and sensual comfort. The Bible isn't against pleasure per se. Wine gladdens the heart of man and oil
makes the face shine (Psalm 104:15). And the overlove of comfort is no more wrong than the overlove of discomfort. Sleeping when you should work (20:13) and working when you should
be resting (Psalm 127:2) are both wrong.

Yet if we become "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God" (2 Timothy 3:4), it leads to disaster-not only economic but also emotional and spiritual. At one level, addiction to comfort
can make people detached, avoiding entanglements with people in order to protect their own time and convenience. It can also lead to literal addictions to substances and sexual practices.
Idolatry takes many forms, and it is the wise man or woman who can locate and destroy anything usurping God's place.

What pleasures are perhaps too important to you-not just giving comfort but giving you a consolation only God should give?

> _Prayer_: Lord Jesus, you left the unimaginable comforts of heaven for a life of hardship on earth for me. Someday I will live in that same unimaginably glorious world. Until then, however,
let me not set my heart on thrills, sensations, and comfort but follow in your footsteps. Amen.

> A kindhearted woman gains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth.... The wise prevail through great power and those who have knowledge muster their strength. (11:16, 24:5)

**POWER**. Another overdesire is the will to power. In 11:16 the word gains means to seize or take hold of through sheer power. That is how ruthless men live. By contrast, the kindhearted woman
is "someone who is characterized by grace... someone who acts for the benefit of others, not expecting a return." While she gives up power to serve others, they serve only their love of
power, which can take many forms. Ambition and careerism can be driven by a desire for wealth as a means of gaining power. The overlove of power can also show itself in people who are
opinionated, poor listeners, argumentative, highly partisan, unteachable, and afraid to admit when they have been in the wrong.

As the woman gains honor, paradoxically, by not seeking honor at all, so Jesus achieved true strength by seeking not power but service. "Who is greater, the one who sits at the table or the
one who serves?...I am among you as one who serves" (Luke 22:27). 24:5 teaches that wisdom itself-not being wise in your own eyes, loving God, disadvantaging yourself for others--is in
the end the greatest power and strength of all.

When did you last give up significant power in order to serve someone else?

> _Prayer_: Lord, there is nothing more seductive than power. If I am honest, I confess that there are many situations and relationships I enjoy mainly because of the power I exercise in them.
Help me to kill the sinful part of my heart that rejoices in that. Amen.

> Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. (27:1)

**CONTROL**. The greatest nightmare of the approval addict is rejection; of the power addict, humiliation; of the comfort addict, suffering; and of the control addict, uncertainty. Though the
sluggard refuses to plan (20:4), the opposite error is to think you can control the future—and your whole life—through planning and management. Those who believe they can eliminate
uncertainty boast about tomorrow, thinking they have planned for every contingency. People with an overneed for control have trouble sharing power, can't delegate, and tend to manipulate
people, using guilt and pressure to get people to do what they want.

But you do not know what is to come. The future is wholly in the hands of God (16:1,3,9). Confidence regarding the future is possible for the wise person, but it is not founded on our own
abilities. Such confidence must be "realistic, modest, and grounded in the fear of the Lord." This overconfidence in one's ability to control life is always haunted by the nagging sin of worry
(Matthew 6:19-34), just as the desire for power is dogged by anger, the fear of man by cowardice, and the lover of pleasure by boredom.

Do you get very anxious when you lose direct control of a relationship or a situation?

> _Prayer_: Lord, you are God, and I will find rest nowhere but in your will, and "that will is infinitely, immeasurably, unspeakably beyond my largest notions of what [you] are up to." Amen.
