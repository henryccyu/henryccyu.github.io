> A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.... A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
(14:30, 17:22)

**THE WHOLE PERSON**. Long before modern medicine and psychology, Proverbs taught that emotional well-being was connected to
physical health and well-being. Envy rots the bones but a cheerful heart is good medicine. Yet today specialization and bureaucratization
mean that physician, psychiatrist, social worker, and minister often end up treating only one isolated aspect of the person, without
consulting one another or looking at the person as a whole.

English minister Richard Baxter, even in the seventeenth century, knew that depression could be rooted in a physiological cause,
emotional trauma, moral guilt, or spiritual warfare with evil forces.21 Baxter was not trained in modern science. He knew this from
the Scripture in general and the book of Proverbs in particular. Godly wisdom refuses to reduce depression, for example, to any one
cause. It does not have simply a chemical or simply a moral or simply a spiritual cause. All the dimensions of our nature are usually
involved. It is foolish to reduce the solution to just "take a pill" or to just "repent."

Have you ever taken a too-simplistic or reductionistic approach to a problem that turned out to be complex-physical, emotional,
and spiritual all at once?

_Prayer_: Lord, as a modern person I love quick solutions for problems that you can access on a short YouTube video. But the world
you've made has far more dimensions than anyone can imagine. Help me to be patient, to seek much advice, and to depend on you in
order to make progress with my problems. Amen.

> Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up. (12:25)

**ANXIETY**. The Hebrew word translated as anxiety means the emotional distress caused when something vital to your life is
threatened. The key to dealing with anxiety is to look at our heart attitude toward the thing threatened. There are many things that
are considered important for a high quality of life in this world. Yet as we have seen, if we rely on God the most, that makes everything
else less vital and thus our lives less fragile.

Anxiety cannot be completely eliminated. Because Paul loved his young churches, he was anxious for them (2 Corinthians 11:28),
and yet he counsels us to avoid debilitating anxiety by deliberately resting our hearts in God rather than anything else (Philippians
4:6-9). In this proverb, however, we are told we should not try to deal with anxiety on our own. We need a kind word from others. We
need people to affirm us, to relate their own experience, to point us to God, or even just to be there so we don't feel so alone.

What helps you the most when you are anxious? Have you used all the spiritual resources you have for anxiety?

_Prayer_: Lord, you have instructed that I deal with anxiety through, among other things, thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6-9). So I
thank you for all the ways in the past you took care of me. And I thank you ahead of time, knowing it will be wise and good, for
whatever you do with my future. Amen.

> Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life. (13:12)

**HOPE**. At the core of the human heart are not just emotions but hopes-things we look to and trust in to make us happy. When
something we long for is deferred or delayed, we become heart-sick.

It is wisdom to recognize that the condition of deferred hopes is one that can never be fully remedied in this life. The book of
Hebrews likens the whole Christian life to the period when the Israelites had been delivered from slavery but were not yet in the
Promised Land (Hebrews 11:13-14). The second clause of 13:12 is saying that when our longings are fulfilled, life flourishes briefly,
as it did back in paradise, where we had access to the Tree of Life (Genesis 2:9). But the New Testament tells us we will know full
satisfaction only in the new heavens and new earth (Revelation 22:2), which will be ours not through our efforts but through the
work of Jesus Christ. As we have seen, his cross became a tree of death for him so that we could have the tree of life by faith. We face
disappointment now by reminding ourselves of what is to come, guaranteed by Christ's sacrifice.

Do an honest assessment-what are your greatest hopes? Are they being "deferred"? How can you use the spiritual resources you
have to help your heartsickness?

_Prayer_: Lord, I often am indeed heartsick because of deferred hopes. Help me strengthen my heart in two ways. Remind me through
your Word that we are in the wilderness, not in the Promised Land. And make yourself my most cherished hope-because I can have
you now! Amen.

## April 17
> Each heart knows its own bitterness, and no one else can share its joy. (14:10)

**ALONE**. No one can fully share the joys and know the sorrows of another human being. No one has experienced your life exactly as
you have. The implications for wisdom are many. From the outside, never be completely assured that you can absolutely predict or
understand the behavior of another person. You may guess wrongly what a person is thinking, what things motivate him or her, and
why certain feelings are so strong.

From the inside, remember that no one can read your mind. If you don't want to be terribly lonely, you will have to open your heart
and reveal yourself. Finally, in the end, only the Lord can know all the thoughts of the heart (1 Corinthians 2:11), and he knows them
better than you do (Jeremiah 17:9-10; Proverbs 21:2). Jesus walked through death for you, and now only he can take you by the hand
when you walk through the ultimate dark place, the door of death (Psalm 23:4).

Though we all need human friendship, it will not replace true friendship with God. Can you say that you enjoy friendship with God?
Why or why not?

_Prayer_: Lord, I have great friends and a great family, but only you are truly, always with me. The only way, then, that I can avoid
terrible loneliness is to spend more and more time with you. Don't let the world squeeze out my time with you. Amen.

## April 18
> Even in laughter the heart may ache, and rejoicing may end in grief. (14:13)

**LOOK DEEPER**. Experienced counselors know well the truths behind this proverb, but anyone who wants to live wisely must know
them too.

First, it means there is a tragedy and a sadness to life from which no amount of celebration or rejoicing can provide a full escape.
Some wounds never really heal. The festal joy that Jesus brings is always partial in this life, never full. Jesus himself did a lot of
weeping, not because of anything wrong with him but because his perfect, loving heart was necessarily affected by the sadness
of human life. So will ours be. Second, "our moods are seldom untinged with their opposites, and are none of them permanent."93
Perhaps the simplest lesson is that we should look past the surface statements of "I'm fine, thanks" and even "life of the party"
behavior and listen more carefully if we are to discern how a person is really doing.

Do you tend to turn everything into a joke or carry on in a lighthearted way? That can be pleasant to some, but might it not be a
denial of or insensitivity to the genuine sadness of life?

_Prayer_: Lord, in this world even the happiest times are tinged with sadness. But that is offset with a knowledge of your promises,
so even the saddest times can be tinged with happiness. Trouble makes us depend more on you and in prayer seek more your love.
Indeed, you make "my griefs to sing." Amen.

## April 19
Light in a messenger's eyes brings joy to the heart, and good news gives health to the bones. (15:30)
JOY. If the verse of April 18 exhorted us to look more carefully to see how a person is doing, this proverb suggests looking at the eyes,
especially at their light. We speak of eyes shining, gleaming, brightening, and we don't mean any literal light coming through them.
Observant people know that even if a person's words are positive, a lack of light in the eyes can reveal sadness. If the messenger here
is the radiant face of a friend who brings some encouraging news, we learn how important relationships are for a life of joy.
So for joy in our hearts we need people with light in their eyes. But where do they get it? Paul tells Christians that they can have a
joy not based on circumstances at all, which requires thoughtfulness and meditation on what God has done for us and will do for us
(Philippians 4:4,11-13). There is, then, a joy that comes only through the ultimate message-the gospel, which literally means "the
news that brings joy." If you believe in Jesus, then you have truly seen "a great light” (Matthew 4:16), and it is inevitable that your eyes
will reflect it to others.

Would anyone say that your joy and happiness lifts up their hearts?

_Prayer_: Lord, give me the joy that I need to live the day. I lack joy because I don't spend sustained time in detailed thanksgiving for
both temporal and spiritual gifts and blessings. And I don't simply rejoice enough just in being in your presence. Provoke me to do the
things that bring your joy into my life. Amen.

> The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion. (28:1)

**GUILT**. Behind the insecurity that many experience is a guilty conscience. The more we lie and betray, the more we fear being betrayed
until we flee though no one pursues. This goes beyond just remorse for past misdeeds. Even in our modern relativistic culture, we see
"The Strange Persistence of Guilt.” We struggle mightily with a sense that there is something wrong with us, that we are not who
we should be. The Bible tells us this is a repressed knowledge that we are sinners (Romans 1:18).

Those whose consciences are clear toward God do not have to be looking back over their shoulders. They can be bold as a lion. Why?
If your sins are covered by God's grace (Psalm 32:1), then your past will not be pursuing you (Numbers 32:23) but only God's goodness
and mercy (Psalm 23:6).9% Lady Macbeth could not rid herself of the stain of guilt on her hands, but Jesus is the messenger of the
covenant (Malachi 3:1-4) who can cleanse us of any stain and guilt (1 John 1:7).

Do you have a guilty conscience about anything?

_Prayer_: Father, when I don't confess the things I know I've done wrong, I overwork and overcommit. I see now that this is because I
am trying to atone for my own sins. But I can't. Let me rest in your Son's sacrifice, and rest content. Amen.

## April 21
> A person may think their own ways are right, but the LORD weighs the heart. (21:2)

**GOD'S SCALES**. 16:2 said we think our motives are pure when they are not (March 27). Here 21:2 says something a bit different. We
think we can determine what is right, just and true, but humans do not define what is right or wrong-God does.27 We live in an era
when we are told, "No one has the right to tell anyone else how to live," that we can define right and wrong for ourselves. Yet this
cultural assumption is riddled with contradictions. We hold it but in the next breath criticize people for bigotry or greed or cruelty.
Justice has one set of scales-God's. He alone weighs every heart.

So don't overly trust your moral instincts and motives. We say we confront people "for their own good," but really are we just trying
to punish them? We tell ourselves we are attracted to someone out of love, but really is it because their looks and beauty build up our
ego? Let God's Word search and sift your instincts and motives through study and prayer.

Are you too quick to ascribe good motives to yourself? Recall a time when you fooled yourself about the real reasons you pursued
something.

_Prayer_: Lord, I whiplash back and forth between too much introspection and too little. Cure this in me with the gospel. Your
unconditional love for me in Christ keeps me from either trying to earn your love through self-examination or fearing to do it at all.
Amen.

## April 22
> The human spirit can endure in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear? (18:14)

**THE CRUSHED SPIRIT**. As we have seen, Proverbs sees that the emotional and physical health are integral and both important. But this
text adds nuance to that. It teaches that without physical well-being, life is hard, and without any joy, it is unbearable.98

What is the implication? There's nothing more important than maintaining your inward, spiritual life. A broken body can be
sustained with difficulty by a strong spirit, but a broken spirit cannot be sustained by even the physically strongest person in the
world. We are taught that our happiness is based on external things such as beauty, health, money, and status. Here we are being told,
"No, it has nothing to do with your outward circumstances. Happiness is determined by how you deal with your circumstances from
inside, how you process, how you address, and how you view them."

Is there anything that is crushing your spirit?

_Prayer_: Lord, I do blame my circumstances for my unhappiness, and that makes me secretly resentful toward you. But my joy is
largely determined by where I rest my heart. Free me from enslavement to circumstance. Let me rest my hope and heart in you.
Amen.

## April 23
> A happy heart inakes the face cheerful, but heartache crushes the spirit. The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on
folly. (15:13-14)

**HAPPINESS IS A CHOICE**. Remember that the "heart" in the Bible is not the emotions but our trusts and attitudes. The happy heart,
we are told here, is the discerning heart, filled with wise convictions and commitments. 15:13-14, then, is telling us that the wise
heart leads to cheerful emotions, and the foolish heart to crushed emotions. The principle is a subtle one but important. It means,
ultimately, that happiness is a choice. Our "thoughts and attitudes...not the circumstances, are decisive.

We have gone far enough in the book of Proverbs to see, however, that we are not talking about mere stoicism, a simple clamping
down of emotions through willpower. The heart consists of the attitudes and stances toward life. We can choose to reflect with our
mind and to fire our imagination through art, singing, and worship all so that the truths and realities of God and of his grace and
promises fill our view.

What is making you unhappy? How can the insights of these proverbs help you today?

_Prayer_: Lord, I am so, so spiritually weak, that in order to live the life I should, I need both a mind convinced by solid arguments and
an imagination fired with the beauty of your character and story. Show me how to bring both into my life. Amen.

## April 24
> Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city. (16:32)

**SELF-CONTROL: THE IMPORTANCE**. A warrior knew how to conquer and master a whole city. But these proverbs argue that even better
is the patient, self-controlled person who knows how to conquer and master himself. This means that is it harder to master yourself
than to master others, or even a whole nation. There are too many examples of world beaters who won prizes or literally conquered
nations but who could not control their tempers, their tongues, or their emotions.

In ancient times people with self-control and prudence were highly admired over those who followed whim and passion. Today self-
control is often seen as unhealthy. Following one's passion, feeling one's anger, and being spontaneous are all valued in the world of
the creative and sophisticated. Yet so many of our most famous celebrities, following this pattern, have made a shipwreck of their
lives. As we have seen, biblical wisdom is all about the goodness of emotion, yet it is God's Word, not our intuitions and feelings, that
must be sovereign.

Where has a lack of self-control brought trouble into your life?

_Prayer_: Lord, the last of the "fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5: 22-23), self-control, seems to be also the slowest to grow in me. I can be
loving and even humble before I can get control of my tongue and behavior. I repent and ask you to show me the way forward. Amen.

## April 25
> Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control. (25:28)

**SELF-CONTROL**: THE PROBLEM. Without a wall the residents of ancient cities were vulnerable to attacks by bands of robbers, other
nations' armies, and even animals. A person who lacks self-control is just as defenseless. If you can't control your appetite for food,
you will ruin your body. If you can't control your tongue or temper, you will say things that can't be unsaid or taken back. If you can't
control your sexual desires, you will ruin relationships. If you are impulsive and imprudent, not thinking things out, you will make
rash decisions. If you can't say no to people, you will overpromise and either be exhausted and overextended or have a life filled with
disillusioned people and broken relationships.

A city doesn't have to be completely without a wall in order to be sacked. The wall just needs to be broken through at one point to let
the enemy in. So a lack of self-control-even in just one area of life is a life-threatening problem.

Where is your "wall" broken or most vulnerable? In what area of life do you most need self-control?

_Prayer_: Lord, help me to do a survey of my life the way ancient soldiers examined their city wall. Show me where I most need
fortification in my self-control. I have an idea, but I want to take time to examine myself with your help. Amen.

## April 26
> The naine of the LORD is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe. The wealth of the rich is their fortified city; they imagine it a wall
too high to scale. (18:10-11)

**SELF-CONTROL**: THE SOLUTION. In ancient times a wall was a safe place in an attack, but a fortified tower was even better. These two
proverbs indicate that everyone has a place of ultimate security, a "fortification," something about which they say, "If I have that, I'll
be safe." The wealthy, the powerful, the beautiful all think that these things are their "towers."

But the wise person runs into the name of the Lord. In the Bible, God's name is a way of speaking of his nature and attributes. To run
into God's name is to deliberately rehearse and tell yourself who he is. Jesus asked his fearful disciples in the storm, "Where is your
faith?" He chastised them for failing to remember all that they had seen him do (Luke 8:25). If you panic, you are failing to remember
(to "run into") his power, his wisdom, his love for you. Self-control in any situation is the critical ability to both recognize and choose
the important thing over the urgent thing. To honor, trust in, and please God is always the most important thing.

What are you facing right now that is difficult? What attribute of God might you be forgetting and might help greatly if you
remembered it?

_Prayer_: Lord, the more you are on the periphery of my thoughts and feelings, the less self-control I have. The more you are in the
center, vividly before the eyes of my heart and attention, the more I can control myself. Lord, grab and hold my attention, moment by
moment, so I can live as I should. Amen.

## April 27
> Evildoers are snared by their own sin, but the righteous shout for joy and are glad. (29:6)

**SHOUT FOR JOY**. Because God's creation has an order within it, evildoers are snared by their own sin. But, as we have seen, the arcs of sin
and righteousness toward their destinies can be very long. For the time being, sin may bring prosperity and righteousness may lead
to suffering. In fact, it is only in eternity that sin receives its full retribution and goodness its complete reward.

So evildoers may not be "snared" for a long time. But there is no reason for believers to wait until the end to shout for joy and be glad.
Indeed, anyone leading a wise life, regardless of the inevitable difficulties, will have times of shout-out-loud joy and laughter. In his
very first miraculous sign, Jesus revealed himself to be Lord of the feast, who comes to bring us festal joy (John 2:1-11). Every time we
participate in the Lord's supper, we are literally getting a foretaste of that final, endless, incomparable feast that has been guaranteed
to us by his death and resurrection (Isaiah 25:6-8; Revelation 19:6-8). Here is the joy that we can access anytime.

When was the last time you experienced shout-out-loud joy in God? Has it been too long?

_Prayer_: Lord, at the wedding feast of Cana (John 2) you sat among the joyous, thinking of your coming sorrow. But you went to the
cross so we can sit here surrounded by sorrows, sipping the coming joy. How I praise you for your great salvation. Amen.
