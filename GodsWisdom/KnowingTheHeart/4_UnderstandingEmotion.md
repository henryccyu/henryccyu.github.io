> A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.... A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
(14:30, 17:22)

**THE WHOLE PERSON**. Long before modern medicine and psychology, Proverbs taught that emotional well-being was connected to
physical health and well-being. Envy rots the bones but a cheerful heart is good medicine. Yet today specialization and bureaucratization
mean that physician, psychiatrist, social worker, and minister often end up treating only one isolated aspect of the person, without
consulting one another or looking at the person as a whole.

English minister Richard Baxter, even in the seventeenth century, knew that depression could be rooted in a physiological cause,
emotional trauma, moral guilt, or spiritual warfare with evil forces.21 Baxter was not trained in modern science. He knew this from
the Scripture in general and the book of Proverbs in particular. Godly wisdom refuses to reduce depression, for example, to any one
cause. It does not have simply a chemical or simply a moral or simply a spiritual cause. All the dimensions of our nature are usually
involved. It is foolish to reduce the solution to just "take a pill" or to just "repent."

Have you ever taken a too-simplistic or reductionistic approach to a problem that turned out to be complex-physical, emotional,
and spiritual all at once?

> _Prayer_: Lord, as a modern person I love quick solutions for problems that you can access on a short YouTube video. But the world
you've made has far more dimensions than anyone can imagine. Help me to be patient, to seek much advice, and to depend on you in
order to make progress with my problems. Amen.
