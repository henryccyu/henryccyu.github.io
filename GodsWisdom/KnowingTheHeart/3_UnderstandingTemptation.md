> She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: "Today I fulfilled my vows, and I have food from my fellowship offering at home." (7:13-15)

**MAGICAL THINKING**. Proverbs chapter 7 dramatically depicts an act of adultery. In the process it teaches us how the heart falls into temptation. At the beginning of the tryst the woman says to
her would-be lover that she has fulfilled her religious vows by making a fellowship offering at the temple (cf. Leviticus 3:1-17). This consisted of a meal that many could eat. So, she says, I have
prayed and sacrificed to God. Now please come to my home to finish the religious observance. And because my husband is not home (7:19), we can then make love. Put more starkly: "After we
finish our prayers and devotions we can commit adultery!"

The disconnect between her public profession of faith and the conduct of her private life is startling but all too common. She has exchanged wholehearted discipleship for a magical view in
which God is more like an idol who can be placated by various observances. We need to learn that unconditional obedience is the only sacrifice that is reasonable, in light of all God has done
for us through creation and redemption (Romans 12:1-2).

Is there any place that you see a disconnect between your public profession of faith and your private life?

> _Prayer_: Lord, I have come to realize or perhaps just to finally admit that there are parts of my life I simply disconnect from my belief in you. I act as if you don't exist in that area of my life.
I repent and ask your help to change that. Amen.

> "So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you! I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. Come, let's drink deeply of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!" (7:15-18)

**ENTERING IN**. Temptation has stages. First comes rationalization (7:14). In this case the lovers share a fellowship sacrifice meal. They must find a way to reconcile the adultery with their self-image as still-being-good people. There are many ways to do this. The self-pitying,
overworking man might look with desire at a woman who is not his wife and say, "After all I've sacrificed, I deserve this."

Second, we believe an overpromise. The woman says, literally, “I looked for you only" (verse 15), meaning "You are the one I've been looking for all my life." What is promised is a kind of cosmic fulfillment that no sexual encounter can ever deliver. Third comes the
titillation of the senses the aromas, the sights, the physical arousal (“I have perfumed my bed... let's drink deeply of love"). By now, applying the brakes and saying no is nearly impossible. Temptation is impossible to completely avoid. But as Martin Luther is reputed to
have said, "While you can't stop the birds from flying over your head, you can stop them from making nests in your hair." That is, stop things before they get away from you.

Have you seen these stages of temptation play out in any area of your life?

> _Prayer_: Lord, you asked your disciples in Gethsemane to watch and pray against temptation, but they did not. Oh, how I want to be different. Help me discern the very first stages of temptation to lust, pride, anger, or greed-so I can turn from sin before I lose control.
Amen.

> "My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey. He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon." With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping
into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. (7:19-23)

**TOO EASY-TOO HARD**. Sometimes there is another stage to temptation (see April 11 for the others). It is reassurance that there will be no real consequences. "My husband is not at home... and will not be home till full moon" (7:19-20). Temptation is extremely powerful if
you believe "no one will ever know!" But in reality there will always be a heavy cost (verse 23) for transgressing the givenness of God's spiritual and moral order. In the case of adultery, it could mean inward and outward shame or the financial and physical danger that
comes from a wronged husband's wrath (6:33-35). And God will always know.

The seventeenth-century writer Thomas Brooks, in his book Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices, argued that Satan tempts you by assuring you that you can always repent later. "But he who now tempts you to sin upon the account that repentance is easy, will, ere
long, bring you to despair, and forever destroy your soul, [and] represent repentance as the most difficult and hardest work in the world."⁹9º

Have you experienced this satanic device? When and how?

> _Prayer_: Lord, I know this demonic lie that I can sin now and later ask forgiveness. But when I've gone that route I've discovered that my heart becomes too hard and despondent to repent. Thank you for today's reminder of this device of Satan, and call it to mind the
next time he uses it on me. Amen.

> Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death. (7:24-27)

DEFENSE. How then can we defend ourselves against the many temptations that face us, whether they are in the arena of sex, money, power, or something else? First, watch your heart (7:25a). Temptation always starts in the inward thoughts. We can't stop ideas from
occurring to us, but we must not entertain them. Fondling the secret thoughts, thinking out rationalizations, exploring the possible consequences-all of these trains of thought are allowing the temptation to make its case to us. Second, we must not stray into her paths
(verse 25b). That is, we should literally stay away from places, situations, and persons that make it easy for our minds to go down the wrong trail.

Third, we should assure ourselves of the inevitable damage and spiritual destruction that always come (a highway to the grave... down to the chambers of death-verse 27). Look down that highway and see the ultimate tragedy and wrongfulness of sin: It grieves God
and spurns the sacrifice he made to save you in Jesus Christ.

Have you seen in your own life how these three strategies have helped you in exercising self-control and defense against temptation?

> _Prayer_: Lord, my ultimate defense against the enticements of sin is to remember that it was sin that led you to the cross. You died—you lost everything to free me from sin. How can I trample on your costly love by giving in to it? Never let this thought leave me. Amen.
