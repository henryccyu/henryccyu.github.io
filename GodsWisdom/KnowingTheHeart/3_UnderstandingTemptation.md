> She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: "Today I fulfilled my vows, and I have food from my fellowship offering at home." (7:13-15)

**MAGICAL THINKING**. Proverbs chapter 7 dramatically depicts an act of adultery. In the process it teaches us how the heart falls into temptation. At the beginning of the tryst the woman says to
her would-be lover that she has fulfilled her religious vows by making a fellowship offering at the temple (cf. Leviticus 3:1-17). This consisted of a meal that many could eat. So, she says, I have
prayed and sacrificed to God. Now please come to my home to finish the religious observance. And because my husband is not home (7:19), we can then make love. Put more starkly: "After we
finish our prayers and devotions we can commit adultery!"

The disconnect between her public profession of faith and the conduct of her private life is startling but all too common. She has exchanged wholehearted discipleship for a magical view in
which God is more like an idol who can be placated by various observances. We need to learn that unconditional obedience is the only sacrifice that is reasonable, in light of all God has done
for us through creation and redemption (Romans 12:1-2).

Is there any place that you see a disconnect between your public profession of faith and your private life?

> _Prayer_: Lord, I have come to realize or perhaps just to finally admit that there are parts of my life I simply disconnect from my belief in you. I act as if you don't exist in that area of my life.
I repent and ask your help to change that. Amen.
