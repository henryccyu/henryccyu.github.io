# Understanding the Heart
## March 24

> Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers. Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they
make someone stumble. (4:14-16)

**ACTIONS SHAPE THE HEART**. Walking on a path always takes you somewhere. Life is likened to a path because every action takes you somewhere. That is, the act changes you, making it easier for
you to do it again. Eventually it becomes so natural to be cruel and selfish that you cannot rest unless you are doing it. "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit,
reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny."

Modern people think feelings determine what we do and that it is hypocritical to act loving if they don't feel loving. Proverbs, however, tells us that our actions shape our feelings. So if you
don't feel love for someone, don't let that stop you. Do the actions of love, and often the feelings follow. When Jesus tells us to love our opponents (Matthew 5:43-48), he does not mean to work
up warm feelings. He is telling us to seek our opponents' good, even at a sacrifice. So start doing the actions of love-take that pathâ€”and you will see your heart changing.

Think of one hard-to-love person in your life. What practical things could you do to begin to love them better?

> _Prayer_: Lord, the feelings of my heart are so unruly, but teach me how to exhort my heart rather than simply listening to it (Psalms 42:5, 103:1-5). And help me in my resolve to also take
charge of it by loving and obeying what you command. Amen.

> The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day. But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble. (4:18-19)

**ACTIONS OPEN THE EYES**. The paths of love and of selfishness lead to two different end points. But they also differ along the way. One path brightens gradually and the other darkens. The
darkness represents increasing self-deception. We say, "I'm not proud, just confident. I'm not abrasive, just direct. I'm not greedy, just sharp in business." The more we follow the path of self,
the more we live in denial until, when life breaks down, we do not know what makes us stumble. Self-deception is not the worst thing you can do, but it's the means by which we do the very
worst things. The sin that is most distorting your life right now is the one you can't see.

On the other hand, those growing in grace (2 Peter 3:18) take the path shining ever brighter. They see more and more things about God and themselves that they were denying. Why? The
gospel so assures us of God's love that we are finally capable of admitting the worst about ourselves. In his love, based on Christ's work, not ours, it is finally safe to do so.

Ask two or three good friends, "What is a character flaw of mine that others can see but I can't see as clearly?"

> _Prayer_: Lord, there is no more important petition than this one-show me my hidden faults. Amen.

> Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you.
Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. (4:23-26)

**THE HEART SHAPES THE ACTIONS**. In the Bible the heart is not primarily the seat of the emotions in contrast to the head as the seat of reason. Rather, the heart is the seat of your deepest trusts,
commitments, and loves, from which everything... flows. What the heart most loves and trusts, the mind finds reasonable, the emotions find desirable, and the will finds doable.

How do you guard your heart? The passage hints that, though ultimately the heart is the central control, our words, eyes, and feet can influence the heart. If we gaze longingly enough at an
object, it may capture our heart through the imagination (as when Achan looked, desired, and finally stole the treasure in Joshua 7). If we speak bitterly against someone, we can sour our heart
toward them. The best way to guard your heart for wisdom is worship, in which the mouth, the mind, the imagination, and even the body are all oriented to God.

Is there some way in which you are failing to guard your heart right now? Are there things you are seeing or doing that may be moving your heart away from God?

> _Prayer_: Lord, help me to guard my heart. Just as I don't want to digest or take bad things into my body, give me the wisdom and self-control not to allow toxic images and beliefs into my heart
through my imagination and thoughts. Amen.
