# KNOWING THE HEART 

## Understanding the Heart
March 24

> Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers. Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way. For they cannot rest until they do evil; they are robbed of sleep till they
make someone stumble. (4:14-16)

ACTIONS SHAPE THE HEART. Walking on a path always takes you somewhere. Life is likened to a path because every action takes you somewhere. That is, the act changes you, making it easier for
you to do it again. Eventually it becomes so natural to be cruel and selfish that you cannot rest unless you are doing it. "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit,
reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny."

Modern people think feelings determine what we do and that it is hypocritical to act loving if they don't feel loving. Proverbs, however, tells us that our actions shape our feelings. So if you
don't feel love for someone, don't let that stop you. Do the actions of love, and often the feelings follow. When Jesus tells us to love our opponents (Matthew 5:43-48), he does not mean to work
up warm feelings. He is telling us to seek our opponents' good, even at a sacrifice. So start doing the actions of love-take that pathâ€”and you will see your heart changing.

Think of one hard-to-love person in your life. What practical things could you do to begin to love them better?

_Prayer_: Lord, the feelings of my heart are so unruly, but teach me how to exhort my heart rather than simply listening to it (Psalms 42:5, 103:1-5). And help me in my resolve to also take
charge of it by loving and obeying what you command. Amen.
