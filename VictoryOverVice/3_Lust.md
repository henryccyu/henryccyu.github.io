## Third Word: Lust
> "Woman, behold thy son; behold thy mother."
>
> -- John 19:26, 27

Lust is an inordinate love of the pleasures of the flesh. The important word here is inordinate, for it was Almighty God Himself who associated pleasure with the flesh. He attached pleasure to eating in order that
we might not be remiss in nourishing and preserving our individual lives. He associated pleasure with the marital act in order that husband and wife might not be remiss in their social obligations to propagate
mankind and raise children for the kingdom of God.

The pleasure becomes sinful at that point where, instead of using it as means, we begin to use it as an end. To eat for the sake of eating is a sin, because eating is a means to an end, which is health. Lust, in like
manner, is selfishness or perverted love. It looks not so much to the good of the other, as to the pleasure of self. It breaks the glass that holds the wine; it breaks the lute to snare the music. It subordinates the other
to self for the sake of pleasure. Denying the quality of "otherness," it seeks to make the other person care for us, but not to make us care for the other person.

We are living today in what might properly be called an era of carnality. As the appeal to the spiritual relaxes, the demands of the flesh increase. Living less for God, human nature begins to live only for self, for
"no man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or he will sustain the one, and despise the other."

Peculiar to this era of carnality is the tendency to equate the perpetuity of marriage with the fleshly pleasure, so that, when the pleasure ends, the bond is presumed to be automatically dissolved. In America, for
example, there is more than one divorce for every two marriages — an indication of how much we have ceased to be a Christian nation and how much we have forgotten the words of our Lord: "What therefore God
hath joined together, let no man put asunder."

The regrettable aspect of it all is that, with this increased sin, there is a decreased sense of sin. Souls sin more, but think less about it. Like the sick who are so moribund that they have no desire to be better, sinners
become so calloused that they have no yearning for redemption. Having lost their eyes, they no longer want to see; the only pleasure left to them in the end is to mock and sneer at those who do.

It is never the pure who say that chastity is impossible but only the impure. We judge others by ourselves, and attribute to others the vices from which we ourselves refuse to abstain.

Some reparation had to be made for the sin of lust that, in Old Testament times, became so hideous to God that He would have withheld the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah could but ten just
men have been found within their gates.

Our Lord began making reparation for it at the first moment of the Incarnation, for He chose to be born of a virgin. Why did He choose to transcend the laws of nature? The answer is very simple. Original Sin has
been propagated to every human being from Adam to this very hour, with the exception of our Lady. The prolongation of this taint in human nature takes place through the carnal act, of which man is the active
principle, for man was the head of the human race. Every time there is generation of one human being by another, through the union of man and woman, there is the propagation of Original Sin.

The problem confronting the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity in becoming man was how to become man without at the same time becoming sinful man, that is, man-infected by the sin to which all flesh is
heir? How to become man without inheriting Original Sin? He had to be a true man in order to suffer for man, but He could not be a sinful man if He were to redeem man from sin. How could he be both man and
yet sinless?

He could be man by being born of a woman; He could be sinless man, without Original Sin, by dispensing with man as the active principle of generation - in other words, by being born of a virgin. Thus it was
that when the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her that she was to conceive the Messiah, whose name would be called Jesus, she answered: "How can this be done, because I know not man?" She had made
the vow of virginity, and she intended to keep it.

The angel answered that the conception of the Son of Man would take place without man, through the power of the Holy Spirit, who would overshadow her. Being assured of her continued virginity, she accepted
the motherhood of God Incarnate. "Be it done unto me, according to thy word."

So it was that reparation for sins of the flesh began the first moment of the Incarnation through the Virgin Birth. That same love He manifested for virginity in the beginning, He re-echoed in the first sermon of
His public life: "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."

Later on, when some scribes and Pharisees sought to malign His good name, He challenged them to find anything impure in His life: "Which of you shall convince me of sin?"

The final atonement and reparation is made on Calvary, where, in reparation for all the impure desires and thoughts of men, our Lord is crowned with thorns; where, in reparation for all the sins of shame, He is
stripped of His garments; where, in reparation for all the lusts of the flesh, He is almost dispossessed of His flesh, for according to Sacred Scripture, the very bones of His Body could be numbered.

We are so used to looking upon artistic crucifixes of ivory and the beautiful images in our prayer books, that we think of our blessed Lord as being whole on the Cross. The fact is that He made such reparation
for sins of the flesh that His Body was torn, His Blood poured forth, and Scripture refers to Him on the Cross as a leper, as one struck by God and afflicted, so that "there is no beauty in Him, nor comeliness...that
we should be desirous of Him."

Our Lord chose to go even further in reparation for the sins of lust by dispossessing Himself of the two most legitimate claims of the flesh. If there was ever a pure and legitimate claim in the realm of the flesh,
it is the claim to the love of one's own mother. If there is any honest title to affection in the universe of the flesh, it is the bonds of love that attach one to a fellowman. But the flesh was so misused by man and so
perverted that our divine Savior renounced even these legitimate bonds of the flesh in order to atone for the illegitimate.

He became totally un-fleshed, in order to atone for the abuse of the flesh, by giving away His Mother and His best friend. So, to His own Mother He looks and bids farewell: "Woman, behold thy son"; and to His
best friend He looks and bids farewell again: “Behold thy mother."

How different from the world! A mother will deprive her son of an advanced education in a foreign land, saying, “I cannot give up my son." Or a wife will deprive her husband of good material advancement
through a short absence, saying, "I cannot give up my husband." These are not the cries of noble love but of attachment. Our Lord did not say, "I cannot give up my Mother." He gave her up. He loved her enough to
give her away for her life's plan and destiny — namely, to be our Mother.

Here was a love that was strong enough to forget itself, in order that others might never want for love. He made the sacrifice of His Mother so that we might have her. He wounded Himself like the pelican, so that
we might be nourished by her motherhood. Mary accepted the poor exchange to carry out her Son's redemptive work. And at that moment when Jesus surrendered even the legitimate claims of the flesh and gave
us His Mother, Mary, and His best friend, John, selfishness died its death.

Two lessons are to be learned from this Third Word from the Cross: that the only real escape from the demands of the flesh is to find something more than the flesh to love; and that Mary is the refuge of sinners.

If we could ever find anything we loved more than the flesh, the demands of the flesh would be less imperative. This is the “escape” a mother offers her boy when she says: "Don't do anything of which your
mother would ever be ashamed." If there is that higher love of his mother, the boy will always have a consecrated sense of affection, something for which he will be willing to make sacrifices.

When a mother makes such an appeal to her son, she is merely echoing the lesson of the Savior, who, in giving His Mother to us as our Mother, equivalently said, “My children, never do anything of which your
Mother would be ashamed." Let a soul but love that Mother, and he will love her divine Son, Jesus, who, in order to make satisfaction for the unlawful pleasure of the flesh, surrendered to us His last and lawful
attachment - His Mother.

The psychology of this enthusiasm for a higher love of Jesus and Mary as an escape from the unlawful attachments of the flesh is this: by it, we avoid undue concentration on lower loves and their explosions.
Think about your mouth for five minutes, and you will have an undue concentration of saliva. Think about your heart for five minutes, and you will believe you have heart trouble, although the chances are nine
out of ten that you have not. Stand on a stage and think about your hands, and they will begin to feel as big as hams.

The balance and equilibrium of the whole system is disturbed when an organ is isolated from its function in the whole organism, or divorced from its higher purpose. People who are always talking, reading, and
thinking about sex are like singers who think more about their larynx than about singing. They make that which is subordinate to a higher purpose so all-important that the harmony of life is upset.

But suppose that, instead of concentrating on an organ, one fitted that organ into a pattern of living; then all the uneasiness would end. The skilled orator never feels his hands are awkward because, being
enthused about his speech, he makes his hands subordinate to their higher purpose.

Our Lord practically said the same thing: "Be not solicitous... what you shall eat." So it is with the flesh. Cultivate a higher love, a purpose of living, a goal of existence, a desire to correspond to all that God wants
us to be, and the lower passion will be absorbed by it.

The Church applies this psychology to the vow of chastity. The Church asks her priests and nuns to surrender even the lawful pleasures of the flesh, not because she does not want them to love, but because she
wants them to love better. She knows that their love for souls will be greater as their love for the flesh is less, just as our Lord died on the Cross for men because He loved His own life less.

Nor must it be thought that the vow of chastity is a burden. Thompson has called it a "passionless passion, a wild tranquility." And so it is. A new passion is born with the vow of chastity, the passion for the love
of God. It is the consolation of that higher love which makes the surrender of the lower love so easy. And only when that higher love is lost does the vow begin to be a burden, just as honesty becomes a burden only
to those who have lost the sense of others' rights.

The reason there is a degeneration in the moral order and a decay of decency is because men and women have lost the higher love. Ignoring Christ their Savior, who loved them unto the death on Calvary, and
Mary who loved them unto becoming Queen of Martyrs beneath that Cross, they have nothing for which to make the sacrifice.

The only way love can be shown in this world is by sacrifice—namely, the surrender of one thing for another. Love is essentially bound up with choice, and choice is a negation, and negation is a sacrifice. When
a young man sets his heart upon a young woman and asks her to marry him, he is not only saying "I choose you”; he is also saying "I do not choose, I reject, all others. I give them all up for you." Apply this to the
problem of lust.

Take away all love above the flesh, take away God, the crucifix, the Sorrowful Mother, salvation, eternal happiness — and what possibility is there for choice? What is to be gained by denying the imperious and
revolutionary demands of the flesh? But grant the divine, and the flesh's greatest joy is to throw itself on the altar of the one loved, where it counts its sorrow a cheap price for the blissful joy of giving.

Then its greatest despair is not to be needed; it could almost find it in its heart to inflict a wound that it might bind and heal. Such is the attitude of the pure. They have integrated their flesh with the divine; they
have sublimated its cravings with the Cross. Having a higher love, they now make the surrender of the lower, so that their Mother may never be put to shame.

Mary is the refuge of sinners. She who is the Virgin Most Pure is also the Refuge of Sinners. She knows what sin is, not by the experience of its falls, not by tasting its bitter regrets, but by seeing what it did to her
divine Son.

She looked upon His torn and bleeding flesh hanging from Him like rays of a purple sunset, and she came to know how much flesh sinned by seeing what His flesh suffered. What better way in all the world was
there to measure the heinousness of sin than by seeing, when left alone with Him for three hours, what it could do to Innocence and Purity.

She is the Refuge of Sinners not only because she knows sin through Calvary, but also because she chose, during the most terrifying hours of her life, a converted sinner as her companion. The measure of our
appreciation of friends is our desire to have them around us in the moment of our greatest need.

Mary heard Jesus say, "The harlots and publicans will enter the kingdom of Heaven before the scribes and Pharisees." So she chose the absolved harlot, Magdalen, as her companion at the Cross. What the
scandalmongers of that day must have said when they saw our Blessed Mother in the company of a woman who everyone knew was the kind who sold her body without giving away her soul.

Magdalen knew that day why Mary is the Refuge of Sinners, and certainly our day, too, can learn that if she had Magdalen as a companion then, she is willing to have us as companions now.

Mary's purity is not a holier-than-thou purity, a standoffish holiness that gathers up its robes lest they be stained by the sinful; nor is it a despising purity that looks down upon the impure. Rather, it is a radiating
purity that is no more spoiled by solicitude for the fallen than a ray of sunshine is sullied by a dirty windowpane through which it pours.

There is no reason for the fallen to be discouraged. Hope is the message of Golgotha. Find a higher love than the flesh, a love pure, understanding, and redeeming, and the struggle will be easy. That higher love
is on the Cross and beneath it.

We almost seem to forget that there is a Cross at all. He begins to look more like a red rose, and she begins to look like the stem. That stem reaches down from Calvary into all our wounded hearts of earth, sucking
up our prayers and petitions and conveying them to Him. That is why roses have thorns in this life — to keep away every disturbing influence that might destroy our union with Jesus and Mary.
