## The Sixth Word: Sloth
> "It is finished."
>
> -- John 19:30

Sloth is a malady of the will that causes us to neglect our duties. Sloth may be physical or spiritual. It is physical when it shows itself in laziness, procrastination, idleness, softness, indifference, and nonchalance. It is spiritual when it shows itself in an indifference to character betterment, a distaste for the spiritual, a hurried
crowding of devotions, lukewarmness, and failure to cultivate virtue.

The classic description of the effects of sloth is to be found in the book of Proverbs: "I passed by the field of the slothful man, and by the vineyard of the foolish man. And behold, it was all filled with nettles, and thorns had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall was broken down. Which, when I had seen, I laid it up in my
heart, and by the example I received instruction. Thou wilt sleep a little, said I, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest; and poverty shall come to thee as a runner, and beggary as an armed man."

Of such indifference to duty our Lord spoke in the book of Revelation: "But because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold, nor hot, I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth."

The life and teaching of our Lord lend no support to the slothful man. When yet only twelve years of age, He speaks of being about His "Father's business,” which was nothing less than redeeming the world. Then, for eighteen years, He worked as a manual laborer, transforming dead and useless things into the child's crib, the
friend's table, Nazarene roofs, and the farmers' wagons, as symbols of His later work by which He would transform hard money-changers and prostitutes into useful citizens of the kingdom of Heaven.

Beginning His public life with calloused hands, He preached the gospel of work: "I must work the works of Him that sent me, whilst it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work." His whole life, in His own words, was spent not in receiving, but in giving: "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister,
and to give His life as a redemption for many."

He earned the right to teach the necessity of work, and lest we live under any illusions that any other work is more important than the saving of souls, even the burial of our fathers, He said to the disciple who asked for such permission, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead."

To the young man who wished to be His disciple, but first wanted to bid farewell to friends at home, our Lord said, "No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." Laboring for bread alone is no fulfillment of His commandment, for to those who wanted more bread, He pleaded, "Labor
not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of Man will give you."

The business of salvation is no easy task. There are two roads through this world and two gates into the future life. "Enter ye in at the narrow gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat. How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life; and few
there are that find it!"

Curiously enough, His invitation goes out only to those who labor for the eternal prize: "Come to me, all you who labor, and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek, and humble of heart. And you shall find rest to your souls. For my yoke is sweet, and my burden light."

So completely had He fulfilled the smallest detail of His Father's business that on the very night of His agony, in the Upper Room in the presence of His Apostles, He could raise His eyes to Heaven and pray, "Father, I have glorified Thee on earth; I have finished the work which Thou gavest me to do." Then, the following afternoon,
as the Carpenter is put to death by His own profession, He cries out from the Cross, in a loud voice, the final reparation for sloth and the song of triumph: "It is consummated."

He did not say, "I die," because death did not come to take Him. He walked to it to conquer it. The last drop in the chalice of redemption was drained; the last nail had been driven in the mansion of the Father's House; the last brush had been touched to the canvas of salvation! His work was done!

But ours is not. It is important to realize this, for there are the slothful who justify themselves by saying they need only faith in Christ to save their souls. Surely He who worked so hard for the world's redemption came not to dispense His followers from work. The servant is not above the master.

Faith in Him alone does not save, for "faith without good works is dead." It is not enough for the student to have faith in his teacher's knowledge; he must also study. It is not enough for the sick to have faith in their doctor; their organism must cooperate with him and his medicine. It is not enough to believe that Washington was
the "father of our country"; we must also assume and fulfill our duties as American citizens.

In like manner, it is not enough to believe in Christ; we must live Christ and, to some extent, die Christ-like. His words permit of no equivocation: “And he that taketh not up his cross, and followeth me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that shall lose his life for me shall find it."

St. Paul understood the labor involved in being a Christian and wrote the same message to the Romans: "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His Resurrection." What He has done with His human nature, we must do with ours: plant it in the soil of the Cross and await
the Resurrection of the eternal Easter.

Later, to the Corinthians, Paul repeated it: "As you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation." And St. Peter, who knew well the scandal of the Cross, pleaded for joy in reliving the Cross: "If you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that when His glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with
exceeding joy."

There is no hope for the spiritually slothful in these injunctions. Our Lord is the die; we must be stamped by it. He is the pattern; we must be remodeled to it. The Cross is the condition; we must be nailed to it. Our Lord loved His Cross so much that He keeps its scars even in His glory. He who had won victory over death kept the
record of its wounds.

If so precious to Him, they cannot be meaningless for us. In their preservation is the reminder that we, too, must be signed with those signs and sealed with those seals.

On Judgment Day, He will say to each of us, "Show me your hands and feet. Where are your scars of victory? Have you fought no battles for truth? Have you won no wars for goodness? Have you made no enemy of evil?"

If we can prove we have been His warriors and show the scars on our apostolic hands, we shall enjoy the peace of victory. But woe unto us who come down from the Calvary of this earthly pilgrimage with hands unscarred and white!

Two lessons emerge from this Sixth Word from the Cross witnessing to Christ's finished work and our own unfinished tasks: First, we must beware of spiritual sloth, for its penalties are tremendous; and second, we must work for a complete life.

The Gospel records three instances of sloth. There were the foolish virgins, chaste but lazy. The wise virgins fill their lamps with oil and wait to hear the step of the approaching bridegroom. The foolish virgins do not think of oil, and tired of waiting, they fall asleep. When the bridegroom comes, the wise virgins light their lamps
and welcome the bridegroom. The foolish virgins go out to buy oil, but everybody is asleep; the shops are closed. They go back to the wedding feast, but the door is closed. They cry, "Lord, Lord, open to us." But His answer is: "Amen, I say to you, I know you not." Our Lord concludes the parable with these words: "Watch, ye, therefore,
because you know not the day nor the hour."

The second instance of sloth was the parable of the barren fig tree: "And the next day, when they came out from Bethania, He was hungry. And when He had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves, He came if perhaps He might find anything on it. And when He was come to it, He found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for
figs. And answering, He said to it, 'May no man hereafter eat fruit of thee anymore forever.” “

The third was the parable of the buried talent. He who received five talents earned another five; he who had received two earned another two; but he who received one hid it in the ground. Of him the lord of the servants said, “Wicked and slothful servant!... Take ye away, therefore, the talent from him, and give it him that hath
ten talents. For to everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away. And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

Common to these three parables is the danger of sloth and the necessity of work. Purity without good works will not save us any more than it saved the foolish virgins. Those who do nothing run the risk of losing the little they have. In other words, it is possible to lose our souls by doing nothing. “How shall we escape if we
neglect...?" We lose our souls not only by the evil we do, but also by the good we leave undone.

Neglect the body, and the muscles stiffen; neglect the mind, and imbecility comes; neglect the soul, and ruin follows. Just as physical life is the sum of the forces that resist death, so the spiritual life is to some extent the sum of the forces that resist evil. Neglect to take an antidote for a poison in the body, and we die by our neglect.
Neglect to take precaution against sin, and we die the death merely because of neglect.

Heaven is a city on a hill. Hence, we cannot coast into it; we have to climb. Those who are too lazy to mount can miss its capture as well as the evil who refuse to seek it. Let no one think he can be totally indifferent to God in this life and suddenly develop a capacity for Him at the moment of death.

Where will the capacity for Heaven come from if we have neglected it on earth? A man cannot suddenly walk into a lecture room on higher mathematics and be thrilled by its equations if all during life he neglected to develop a taste for mathematics. A heaven of poets would be a hell to those who never learned to love poetry.
And a heaven of divine truth, righteousness, and justice would be a hell to those who never studiously cultivated those virtues here below. Heaven is only for those who work for Heaven.

If we crush every inspiration of the Divine; if we drown every Godward inspiration of the soul; if we choke every inlet to Christ—where will be our relish for God on the last day? The very things we neglected will then be the very cause of our ruin. The very things that should have ministered to our growth will then turn against
us and minister to our decay.

The sun that warms the plant can, under other conditions, also wither it. The rain that nourishes the flower can, under other conditions, rot it. The same sun shines upon mud that shines upon wax. It hardens the mud but softens the wax. The difference is not in the sun, but in that upon which it shines.

So it is with God. The divine life that shines upon a soul who loves Him, softens it into everlasting life; that same divine life that shines upon the slothful soul, neglectful of God, hardens it into everlasting death.

Heaven and Hell are, in like manner, both effects of divine goodness. Their difference comes from our reaction to that goodness and, to that extent, are also our creations. Both God and man are in different senses creators of Heaven and Hell.

A little heed, then, to this word from the Cross: "It is consummated." We finish our vocation as He finished His — on a cross and nowhere else. Only to the doers of the truth, and not to its preachers or its hearers, comes the reward of the crown. Doing implies the spending not of what we have, but of what we are.

We need have no undue fear for our health if we work hard for the kingdom of God. God will take care of our health if we take care of His cause. In any case, it is better to burn out than to rust out.

Burning the candle at both ends for God's sake may be foolishness to the world, but it is a profitable Christian exercise — for so much better the light. Only one thing in life matters: being found worthy of the Light of the World in the hour of His visitation.

"Take ye heed," He said. "Take ye heed, watch and pray. For ye know not when the time is. Even as a man who going into a far country, left his house, and gave authority to his servants over every work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore (for you know not when the lord of the house cometh: at even, or at
midnight, or at the cock crowing, or in the morning), lest coming on a sudden, he find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch."

Not only must we beware of spiritual sloth, but we must also work for a completed life. The important word in the struggle against sloth is finished. The world judges us by results; our Lord judges us by the way we fulfill and finish our appointed tasks. A good life is not necessarily a successful life.

The sowers are not always the reapers. Those whom God destines only to sow receive their reward for just that, even though they never garnered a single sheaf into everlasting barns. In the parable of the talents, the reward is according to the development of potentialities and the completion of appointed duties.

One day, our Lord, "sitting over against the treasury, beheld how the people cast money into the treasury, and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she cast in two mites, which make about half a cent. And calling His disciples together, He saith to them, 'Amen, I say to you, this poor widow
hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury. For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want cast in all she had, even her whole living.” “

The result was trivial for the treasury, but it was infinite for her soul. She had not half-done her duty; she had finished it. This is what is meant by completed living.

In the Christian order, it is not the important who are essential, nor those who do great things who are really great. A king is no nobler in the sight of God than a peasant. The head of government, with millions of troops at his command, is no more precious in the sight of God than a paralyzed child. The former has greater
opportunities for evil, but like the widow in the Temple, if the child fulfills his task of resignation to the will of God more than the dictator fulfills his task of procuring social justice for the glory of God, then the child is greater. "God is no respecter of persons."

Men and women are only actors on the stage of life. Why should he who plays the part of the rich man glory in his gold and rich table and consider himself better than one who plays the role of the beggar begging a crumb from his table. When the curtain goes down, they are both men.

So when God pulls down the curtain on the drama of the world's redemption, He will not ask what part we played, but only how well we played the role assigned to us. The Little Flower has said that one could save one's soul by picking up pins out of love of God.

If we could create worlds and drop them into space from our fingertips, we would please God no more than by dropping a coin into a tin cup. It is not what is done, but why it is done that matters. A bootblack shining a pair of shoes inspired by a divine motive is doing more good for this world than all the godless conventions
Moscow could ever convene.

It is the intention that makes the work. Duties in life are like marble, canvas, and stone. Marble becomes valuable because of the image given to it by the sculptor; canvas is ennobled by the picture of the artist; and stone is glorified by the pattern of the architect.

So it is with our works. The intention gives them value as the image gives the marble value. God is not interested in what we do with our hands, or our money, or our minds, or our mouths, but with our wills. It is not the work but the worker that counts.

Let those souls who think their work has no value recognize that, by fulfilling their insignificant tasks out of a love of God, those tasks assume a supernatural worth. The aged who bear the taunts of the young, the sick crucified to their beds, the ignorant immigrant in the steel mill, the street cleaner and the garbage collector, the
wardrobe mistress in the theater and the chorus girl who never had a line, the unemployed carpenter and the ash collector-all these will be enthroned above dictators, presidents, kings, and cardinals if a greater love of God inspires their humbler tasks than inspires those who play nobler roles with less love.

No work is finished until we do it for the honor and glory of God. "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever else you do, do all to the glory of God." When our lease on life runs out, two questions will be asked. The world will ask, "How much did he leave?" The angels will ask, "How much did he bring with him?"

The soul can carry much, but in its journey to the judgment seat of God, it will be freighted down only with that kind of goods which a man can carry away from a shipwreck - his good works done for the glory of God. All that we leave behind is "unfinished." All that we take with us is "finished."

May we never die too soon! This does not mean not dying young; it means not dying with our appointed tasks undone. It is indeed a curious fact that no one ever thinks of our Lord as dying too young! That is because He finished His Father's business. But no matter how old we are when we die, we always feel there is something
more to be done.

Why do we feel that way, if it is not because we did not do well the tasks assigned to us? Our task may not be great; it may be only to add one stone to the Temple of God. But whatever it is, do each tiny little act in union with your Savior, who died on the Cross, and you will finish your life. Then you will never die too young!
