## The Seventh Word: Covetousness
> "Father, into Thy hands, I commend my spirit."
>
> -- Luke 23:46

Covetousness is an inordinate love of the things of this world. It becomes inordinate if one is not guided by a reasonable end, such as a suitable provision for one's family, or the future, or if one is too solicitous in amassing wealth, or too parsimonious in dispensing it. The sin of covetousness includes, therefore, both the intention
one has in acquiring the goods of this world and the manner of acquiring them. It is not the love of an excessive sum that makes it wrong, but an inordinate love of any sum.

Simply because a man has a great fortune, it does not follow that he is a covetous man. A child with a few pennies might possibly be more covetous. Material things are lawful and necessary to enable us to live according to our station in life, to mitigate suffering, to advance the kingdom of God, and to save our souls.

It is the pursuit of wealth as an end, instead of a means to the above ends, that makes a man covetous.

In this class of the covetous are to be placed the young woman who marries a divorced man for his money; the public official who accepts a bribe; the capitalist who puts profits above human rights and needs, and the laborer who puts party power above the laborer's rights.

Covetousness is much more general in the world today than we suspect. It once was monopolized by the avaricious rich; now it is shared by the envious poor. Because a man has no money in his pockets is no proof that he is not covetous; he may be involuntarily poor with a passion for wealth far in excess of those who possess.

History bears witness to the fact that almost every radical economic revolutionist in history has been interested in only one thing: booty. The only poor people who ever attacked the rich and sought nothing for themselves were our Lord and His followers, like St. Francis of Assisi.

There are very few disinterested lovers of the poor today; most of their so-called champions do not love the poor as much as they hate the rich. They hate all the rich, but they love only those poor who will help them attain their wicked ends.

Such covetousness is ruinous for man, principally because it hardens the heart. Man becomes like unto that which he loves, and if he loves gold, he becomes like it — cold, hard, and yellow. The more he acquires, the more he suffers at surrendering even the least of it, just as it hurts to have a single hair pulled out even though
your head is full of them.

The more the sinfully rich man gets, the more he believes he is needy. He is always poor in his own eyes. The sense of the spiritual thus becomes so deadened that its most precious treasures are bartered away for the trivial increases, as Judas sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver.

As St. Paul tells us, "The desire for money is the root of all evils, which some coveting have erred from the Faith." The Providence of God becomes less and less a reality, and if it still retains value, it is reduced to a secondary role; God is trusted as long as we have a good bank account.

When things go well, we are quite willing to dispense with God, like the young man in the Gospel who came to our Lord only because he was being deprived of some of his father's estate. “Master, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me." It was only when economic confusion arose that the young man had
recourse to the Divine.

There are many in the world today who think that the only reason for the existence of the Church is to improve the economic order, and if they do not have their fill, they assail the Church for failing. Well indeed might the Church answer in the words of our Lord: "O man, who hath appointed me judge and divider over you?"

To turn man's heart away from perishable things to the eternal values of the soul was one of the reasons for the Lord's visit to the earth. His teaching from the beginning was not only a warning against covetousness, but a plea for a greater trust in Providence.

"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where thy treasure is, there will thy heart be also."

I say to you therefore, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall wear. Is not the life of more consequence than the food, and the body than the clothing? Look at the birds of the sky, how they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly
Father feeds them! Are you not of much more value than they? Yet who among you by anxious thought is able to add a single span to his life?

And why should you worry about clothing? Observe the field-lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his magnificence was not arrayed like one of them. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which exists today and is thrown in the oven tomorrow, will He not much rather clothe
you, O you of little faith?

Do not therefore worry saying, "What shall we eat?" "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?" for the heathen seek after all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and His holiness, and all these things shall be given you besides. Do not then be anxious about
tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. Quite enough for the day is its own trouble.

The man who unduly loves riches is a fallen man, because of a bad exchange; he might have had Heaven through his generosity, and he has only the earth. He could have kept his soul, but he sold it for material things. Camels will pass through eyes of needles more easily than the covetous will pass through the gates of Heaven.
It was easy, of course, to condemn the rich; our world is too full of those who are doing it now. But our economic revolutionists do it because they envy wealth, not because they love poverty.

It was not so with our divine Savior. He who condemned Dives and the man who ordered bigger barns the very day he died, and who thundered that no man could serve God and mammon, lived His gospel. Not in a hospital, or a home, or a city, but in a stable in the fields did He bow entrance into the world He made. Not with
money did He make money in the markets of exchange, but as a poor carpenter.

He earned His living with the two most primitive instruments used: wood and hammer. During His three years of preaching, not even a roof could He claim as His own: “The foxes have burrows, and the birds of the sky have nests; but the Son of Man has not a place where He may lay His head."

Then, at His death, He had no wealth to leave; His Mother he gave to John; His body to the tomb; His blood to the earth; His garments to His executioners. Absolutely dispossessed, He is still hated, to give the lie to those who say religion is hated because of its possessions.

Religion is hated because it is religion, and possessions are only the excuse and pretext for driving God from the earth. There was no quarreling about His will; there was no dispute about how His property would be divided; there was no lawsuit over the Lord of the universe.

He had given up everything in reparation for covetousness, keeping only one thing for Himself that was not a thing: His Spirit. With a loud cry, so powerful that it freed His soul from His flesh and bore witness to the fact that He was giving up His life and not having it taken away, He said in farewell, "Father, into Thy hands I
commend my spirit."

It rang out over the darkness and lost itself in the furthermost ends of the earth. The world has made all kinds of noise since to drown it out.

Men have busied themselves with nothing to shut out hearing it; but through the fog and darkness of cities, and the silence of the night, that awful cry rings within the hearing of everyone who does not force himself to forget, and as we listen to it, we learn two lessons: the more ties we have to earth, the harder will it be for us
to die; and we were never meant to be perfectly satisfied here below.

In every friendship, hearts grow and entwine themselves together, so that the two hearts seem to make only one heart with only a common thought. That is why separation is so painful. It is not so much two hearts separating, but one heart being torn asunder.

When a man loves wealth inordinately, he and it grow together like a tree pushing itself in growth through the crevices of a rock. Death to such a man is a painful wrench, because of his close identification with the material. He has everything to live for, nothing to die for. He becomes at death the most destitute and despoiled
beggar in the universe, for he has nothing he can take with him. He discovers too late that he did not belong to himself, but to things, for wealth is a pitiless master.

It would not allow him during life to think of anything else except increasing itself. Now he discovers too late that by consecrating himself to filling his barns, he was never free to save the only thing he could carry with him to eternity: his soul. In order to acquire a part, he lost the whole. He won a fraction of the earth; now he
will need only six feet of it.

Like a giant tied down by ten thousand ropes to ten thousand stakes, he is no longer free to think about anything else than what he must leave. That is why death is so hard for the covetous rich.

On the contrary, as the ties to earth become lessened, the easier is the separation. Where our treasure is, there is our heart also. If we have lived for God, then death is a liberation. Earth and its possessions are the cage that confines us, and death is the opening of its door, enabling our soul to wing its way to its Beloved, for which
it had only lived and for which it only waited to die.

Our powers of dispossession are greater than our powers of possession; our hands could never contain all the gold in the world, but we can wash our hands of its desire. We cannot own the world, but we can disown it. That is why the soul with the vow of poverty is more satisfied than the richest covetous man in the world, for
the latter has not yet all he wants, while the religious wants nothing; in a certain sense, the religious has all and is perfectly happy.

It was such poverty of spirit raised to its most sublime peak that made the death of our Lord so easy. He had no ties to earth. His treasure was with the Father, and His soul followed the spiritual law of gravitation.

Cold, like dirt, falls; charity, like fire, rises: "Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.”

The death of our Lord on the Cross reveals that we are meant to be perpetually dissatisfied here below. If earth were meant to be a Paradise, then He who made it would never have taken leave of it on Good Friday. The commending of the spirit to the Father was at the same time the refusal to commend it to earth. The completion
or fulfillment of life is in Heaven, not on earth.

Our Lord in His last word is saying that nowhere else can we be satisfied except in God. It is absolutely impossible for us to be perfectly happy here below. Nothing proves this more than disappointment. One might almost say the essence of life is disappointment.

We look forward to a position, to marriage, to ownership, to power, to popularity, to wealth, and when we attain them, we have to admit, if we are honest, that they never come up to our expectations.

As children, we looked forward to Christmas; when it came and we had our fill of sweets and tested every toy or rocked every doll, and then crept into our beds, we said in our own little heart of hearts: "Somehow or other, it did not quite come up to expectations." That experience is repeated a thousand times in life.

But why is there disappointment? Because when we look forward to a future ideal, we endow it with something of the infinity of the soul. I can imagine a house with ten thousand rooms studded with diamonds and emeralds, but I shall never see one. I can imagine a mountain of gold, but I shall never see one.

So with our earthly ideals. We color them with the qualities of our spiritual soul. But when they become realized, they are concrete, cabined, cribbed, confined. A tremendous disproportion thus arises between the ideal we conceived and the reality before us.

That disproportion between the infinite and the finite is the cause of disappointment. There is no escaping this fact. We have eternity in our heart, but time on our hands. The soul demands a heaven, and we get only an earth. Our eyes look up to the mountains, but they rest only on the plains. It is easier to strangle our ideals
than it is to satisfy them. He who attains his earthly ideal smashes it.

To touch an ideal in this world is to destroy the ideal. "No man is a hero to his valet." We are no longer thirsty at the border of a well. The satisfaction of earthly ideals turns against us, like a cruel retort from one we paid an underhand compliment.

But there is no reason for being pessimists or cynics. Disappointment is no proof that there is no ideal, but only that it is not here. Just as we would have no eyes were there no beauties to see, and as we would have no ears were there no harmonies to hear, so we would have no appetite for the infinite were there no God to love.

In Him alone is the reconciliation of the chase and the capture. Here on this earth, we are buffeted between the two. The chase has its thrill, for it is the pursuit of an ideal, the quest for satisfaction, and the march to victory. The capture, too, has its thrill, for it is possession, enjoyment, and peace.

But while we live in time, we can never enjoy both together. The capture ends the excitement of the chase; and the chase without a capture is maddening, like having a refreshing spring withdrawn from our parched lips as we draw near to it.

How to combine the chase without the ennui of capture, and the capture without losing the joy of the chase?

It is impossible here below, but not in Heaven, for when we attain unto God, we capture the infinite, and because He is infinite, it will take an eternity of chase to discover the undiscoverable joys of life, truth, love, and beauty.

Such is the meaning behind the last and farewell word from the Cross. Centuries ago the sun shone upon plants and trees and imprisoned within them its light and heat. Today we dig up that light and heat in coal, and as its flames mount upward, we pay back our debt to the sun.

So now the divine Light, which for thirty-three years has been imprisoning Itself in human hearts, goes back again to the Father, ever to remind us that only by completing a similar circuit and commending our souls to the Father do we find the answer to the riddle of life, and the end of disappointment and the beginning of
eternal peace for our eternal hearts.

Everything is disappointing except the redemptive love of our Lord. You can go on acquiring things, but you will be poor until your soul is filled with the love of Him who died on the Cross for you. As the eye was made for seeing and the ear for hearing, so your spirit was made to be recommended back again to God.

If it had any other destiny, the dying words of the Savior would have betrayed that destiny. The spirit has a capacity for the infinite; the knowledge of one flower, the life of a single hour, the love of a minute do not exhaust its potencies. It wants the fullness of these things; in a word, it wants God.

The tragedy of our modern life is that so many put their pleasures in desires rather than in discovery. Having lost the one purpose of human living-namely, God—they seek substitutes in the petty things of earth.

After repeated disappointments, they begin to put their happiness not in a pleasure, but in the hunt for it, in butterfly existences that never rest long enough at any one moment to know their inner desires; running races, hoping they will never end; turning pages but never discovering the plot; knocking at doors of truth and
then dashing away, lest its portals be opened and they be invited in. Existence becomes a flight from peace, rather than an advance; a momentary escape from frustration instead of its sublimation in victory.

Every now and then, there comes to some a light through the clouds of Calvary and the echo of the word commending a spirit to God, but instead of making a supreme effort to satisfy the goal of life, they crucify it.

"But the husbandmen said one to another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours.' And laying hold of him, they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard."

Thus do some men believe that if they could drive God from the earth, the inheritance of sin would be there without remorse; and if they could but silence conscience, they could inherit peace without justice. It was just this mentality that sent our Lord to the Cross. If the voice of God could be stifled, they believed they could
enjoy the voice of Satan in peace.

Now take a different outlook on the world. How many, even of those who have killed conscience, can say, "I am happy; there is nothing I want"? But if you are not brave enough to say that, then why not seek? And why not seek in the one direction in which you know happiness lies?

At death, you will leave everything, but there is one thing you will not leave: your desire for life. You want the one thing the Cross brings you: life through death.

In its effulgence, the mystery of existence becomes clear. The Cross refers to me, personally and individually as if no one else in the world ever existed. On the Cross, Christ has traced for me in sacrifice, which is the most sublime of gestures, a program of life, submission to the divine will. He went down the dark road of Gethsemane
to Calvary's death out of devotedness to God's glory and my salvation.

For my culpable self-indulgence, He atones by surrender of Himself. "He was wounded for our iniquities; He was bruised for our sins. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him."

If this Master of the world's symphony would miss my single note of virtue in the harmony of the universe; if this Captain of wars would miss my spear in His battle for goodness; if this Artist would miss my little daub of color in the masterpiece of redemption; if this cosmic Architect would note the absence of my little stone
in the building of His temple; if this Tree of Life would feel the fall of but my little leaf to the sinfulness of earth; if this heavenly Father would miss me in the empty chair at the banquet spread for the millions of the children of God; if this Orator from the pulpit of the Cross would note my inattention as I turned to glance at an
executioner; if God cares that much for me, then I must be worth something, since He loves me so!
