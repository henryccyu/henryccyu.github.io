## The Fifth Word: Gluttony
> "I thirst."
>
> -- John 19:28

Gluttony is an inordinate indulgence in food or drink, either in taking more than is necessary, in taking it at the wrong time, or in taking it too luxuriously. It is sinful because reason demands that food and drink
be taken for the necessities and conveniences of nature, not for pleasure alone.

The Gospel describes Dives as being guilty of this sin. There is no mention that Dives was a wicked man. We have no record of him underpaying his servants or of being guilty of any moral turpitude. Our Lord
tells us only that he was "clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day."And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores, desiring to be filled with the crumbs
that fell from the rich man's table, and no one did give him; moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich
man also died, and he was buried in hell. And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said: "Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."

And Abraham said to him: "Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented. And besides all this, between us
and you, there is fixed a great chaos, so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither."

And he said, "Then, father, I beseech thee that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren, that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments."

And Abraham said to him, "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." But he said, "No, father Abraham; but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance." And he said to him, "If they
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead."

If there is any indication of the present degeneration of society better than another, it is the excess of luxury in the modern world. When men begin to forget their souls, they begin to take great care of their
bodies. There are more athletic clubs in the modern world than there are spiritual retreat houses; and who shall count the millions spent in beauty shops to glorify faces that will one day be the prey of worms?

It is not particularly difficult to find thousands who will spend two or three hours a day in exercising, but if you ask them to bend their knees to God in five minutes of prayer, they protest that it is too long.
Added to this is the shocking amount that is yearly spent, not in the normal pleasure of drinking, but in its excess. The scandal increases when one considers the necessary wants of the poor which could have been
supplied by the amount spent for such dehumanization. The divine judgment upon Dives is bound to be repeated upon many of our generation, who will find that the beggars for whose service they refused to
interrupt their luxuries will be seated at the banquet of the King of Kings, while they, like Dives, will be the beggars for but a drop of water.

Some reparation had to be made for gluttony, drunkenness, and excessive luxury. That reparation began at the birth of our Lord, when He who might have pulled down the heavens for His housetop and the stars
for His chandeliers, chose to be rejected by men and driven as an outcast to a cave in the hillsides of the least of the cities of Israel.

The very first sermon He preached was a plea for detachment: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven." He began His public life by fasting forty days and bade men, "Be not solicitous
for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on."

Traveling about as an itinerant prophet, He admitted He was as homeless as at His birth and that the beasts and birds had a better habitation than He: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air, nests; but the
Son of Man hath not where to lay His head."

There was no luxury in the way He dined, for we know of but one meal that He himself prepared, and it consisted only of bread and fish.

Finally, at the Cross, He is stripped of His garments and denied a deathbed, in order to go out of His own world as He came into it: Lord of it and yet possessing nothing. The waters of the sea were His, and all the
fountains of the earth had sprung up at His word; He it was who drew the bolt of nature's waterfalls and shut up the seas with doors; He it was who said, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but
he that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not thirst forever. If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink."

But now He lets fall from His lips the shortest of the seven cries from the Cross and the one that expresses the keenest of all human sufferings in reparation for those who have had their fill: "I thirst."

A soldier immediately put a sponge full of vinegar on a stick and pressed it to His mouth. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy uttered by the psalmist a thousand years before: "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to
drink."

He who fed the birds of the air is left unfed; He who changed water into wine now thirsts; the everlasting fountains are dry; the God-man is poverty-stricken. The divine "Lazarus" stands at the world's door and
begs for a crumb and a drop, but the door of generosity is closed in His face.

Thus was reparation made for the luxury of eating and drinking. When Mirabeau was dying, he called for opium, saying, “You promised to spare me needless suffering.... Support this head, the greatest head
in France." When Christ is dying, He refuses the drug to alleviate His suffering. He deliberately wills to feel the most poignant of human wants, so that He might balance in the scales of justice those who had more
than they needed.

He even made Himself the least of all men by asking them for a drink - not a drink of earthly water. That is not what He wanted, but a drink for His thirsty heart - a drink of love: I thirst for love.

This word from the Cross reveals that there is a double hunger and a double thirst: one of the body, the other of the soul. On many previous occasions, our Lord had distinguished between them: "Woe to you that
are filled, for you shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh, for you shall mourn and weep.” “Blessed are ye that hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now, for you shall laugh.”

Then to the multitude who followed Him across the sea in search of bread, He said: “Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of Man will give you."

To the Samaritan woman who came to draw water at Jacob's well, He foretold, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him shall not thirst forever.
But the water that I will give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting."

But above all other references to the food and drink of the inner man as contrasted with that of the outer man, He promised the supreme nourishment of Himself: "For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
drink indeed."

In the light of this double hunger and thirst of body and soul, the distinction between dieting and fasting becomes clear. The Church fasts; the world diets. Materially there is no difference, for a person can lose
twenty pounds one way as well as the other. The difference is in the intention.

The Christian fasts not for the sake of the body, but for the sake of the soul; the pagan fasts not for the sake of the soul, but for the sake of the body. The Christian does not fast because he believes the body is
wicked, but in order to make it pliable in the hands of the soul, like a tool in the hands of a skilled workman.

That brings us down to the basic problem of life. Is the soul the tool of the body, or the body the tool of the soul? Should the soul do what the body wants, or should the body do what the soul wants? Each has its
appetites, and each is imperious in the satisfaction of its wants. If we please one, we displease the other, and vice versa. Both of them cannot sit down together at the banquet of life.

The development of character depends on which hunger and thirst we cultivate. To diet or to fast — that is the problem. To lose a double chin in order to be more beautiful in the eyes of creatures or to lose it in
order to keep the body tamed and ever obedient to the spiritual demands of the soul—that is the question. Human worth can be judged by human desires.

Tell me your hungers and your thirsts, and I will tell you what you are. Do you hunger for money more than for mercy, for riches more than for virtue, and for power more than for service? Then you are selfish,
pampered, and proud. Do you thirst for the wine of everlasting life more than for pleasure, and for the poor more than for the favor of the rich, and for souls more than for the first places at table? Then you are a
humble Christian.

The great pity is that so many have been so concerned with the body that they neglect the soul, and in neglecting the soul, they lose the appetite for the spiritual. Just as it is possible in the physiological order for
a man to lose all appetite for food, so it is possible in the spiritual order to lose all desire for the supernatural. Gluttonous about the perishable, they become indifferent to the everlasting.

Like deaf ears, which are dead to the environment of harmony, and blind eyes, which are dead to the environment of beauty, so warped souls become dead to the environment of the divine.

Darwin tells us in his autobiography that, in his love for the biological, he lost all the taste he once had for poetry and music, and he regretted the loss all the days of his life. Nothing so much dulls the capacity
for the spiritual as excessive dedication to the material.

Excessive love of money destroys a sense of value; excessive love of the flesh kills the values of the spirit. Then comes a moment when everything seems to rebel against the higher law of our being. As the poet
has put it, "All things betrayest thee, who betrayest me." Nature is so loyal to its Maker that it is always in the end disloyal to those who abuse it. "Traitorous trueness and loyal deceit" is its best poetic description,
for in faithfulness to Him it will always be fickle with us.

The Fifth Word from the Cross is God's plea to the human heart to satisfy itself at the only satisfying fountains. God cannot compel men to thirst for the holy in place of the base, or for the divine rather than the
secular. That is why His plea is merely an affirmation: "I thirst," meaning, "I thirst to be thirsted for." And His thirst is our salvation.

A twofold recommendation is hidden in this short sermon from the Cross: first, to mortify bodily hunger and thirst, and second, to cultivate a spiritual hunger and thirst.

We are to mortify bodily hunger and thirst, not because the flesh is wicked, but because the soul must ever exercise mastery over it, lest it become a tyrant. Quite apart from avoiding all excesses, the Cross
commits us even to the minimizing of expenditures for luxuries, for the sake of the poor. How many ever think of forgoing an elaborate dinner and theater party, or a debut, out of genuine sympathy and affection
for Christ's poor? Dives did not, and he lost his soul because of that forgetfulness. How many, in less ample circumstances, even mortify themselves one movie a month in order to drop its equivalent in the poor
box, that He who sees in secret may reward in secret?

The divine counsel concerning such restraint of bodily appetites is unmistakable. On one occasion, when our Lord was invited to the home of the prince of the Pharisees, He addressed the host himself saying,
"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy neighbors who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee. But when
thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind. And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense; for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection
of the just."

The money we spend in the excesses of bodily hunger and thirst will do us no good on the last day; but the poor whom we have assisted by our restraint and mortification will stand up as so many advocates
before the bar of divine justice and will plead for mercy on our souls, even though they once were heavily laden with sin.

The heavenly Judge cannot be bought with money, but He can be swayed by the poor. On that last day—the only one that really counts — will be fulfilled the beautifully prophetic words of the Mother of our
Lord: "He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away."

When such surrenders of the superfluous food and drink are made for the soul's sake, let it all be done in a spirit of joy. "And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that they
may appear unto men to fast. Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in
secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee."

We are, in addition, to cultivate a spiritual hunger and thirst. Mortification of the bodily appetites is only a means, not an end. The end is union with God, the soul's desire. "Taste and see that the Lord is sweet."
The great tragedy of life is not so much what men have suffered, but what they have missed. It comes within the compass of a few to satisfy their earthly desires with wealth, but there is no man living, who, if he
willed it, could not enjoy the spiritual food and drink that God serves to all who ask.

And yet how few there are who ever think of nourishing their souls. How few there must have been in Jerusalem to have drawn from our Lord the sweet complaint: "How often would I have gathered together
thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldst not?"

Well indeed might the Savior say to us, as we listen to the cry “I thirst,” the words he addressed to the woman at the well: “If thou didst know the gift of God, and who He is that saith to thee, 'Give me to drink';
thou perhaps wouldst have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.”

But how many ask? Consider the greatest gift of God to men: the Bread of Life. How few avail themselves of the divine presence to break their fast each morning on the heavenly food of the soul!

How many are sufficiently conscious that our Lord is present in the tabernacle to pay a daily visit to Him in His prison of Love? If we do not, what does it witness to but the deadening of our spiritual sense. Our
body would miss a dessert more than our soul would miss a Communion.

No wonder our crucified Redeemer thirsted for us on the Cross — thirsted for our unresponsive hearts and dulled souls. And let us not think that His thirst is a proof of His need, but of our own. He does not need
us for His perfection any more than we need the flower that blooms outside our window for our perfection. In dry seasons, we desire rain for the flower, not because we need the rain, but because the flower needs it.

In like manner, God thirsts for us, not because He needs us for His happiness, but because we need Him for our happiness. Without Him, it is impossible for us to develop. Just as certain diseases, such as rickets
and anemia, arise in the body from a deficiency of necessary vitamins, so, too, our characters fail because of a deficiency of the Spirit.

The vast majority of men and women in the world today are so underdeveloped spiritually that if a like deficiency showed in their bodies, they would be physical monstrosities.

How many millions of minds there are today that are devoid of one single satisfying truth that they can carry through life to sustain them in their sorrows and console them at their death? How many millions
of wills there are that have not yet found the goal of life and that, because they are presently without it, flit like butterflies from one colored emotion to another, unable to find repose? Let them cultivate a taste for
something more than bread and circuses; let them sound the depths of their beings to discover there the arid wastes crying for the refreshment of everlasting fountains.

Of course, these emaciated hungry souls are not altogether to blame. They have heard preachers without end preaching, "Go to Christ!" But what does that mean? Go back two thousand years? If so, then have
they not a right to doubt the divinity of Him who could not project Himself through time?

Look up to Heaven? If so, then what has become of His blessing, His forgiveness of sinners, His Truth that He said would endure unto the end of time? Where is His authority? His power? His life now? If it is not
someplace on earth, then why did He come to earth? To leave only the echo of His words, the record of His deeds, and then to slip away leaving us only a history and its teachers?

Somewhere on earth today is His truth: "He that heareth you, heareth me." Somewhere on earth is His power: “Behold, I have given you power...." Somewhere on earth is His life: "The bread that I will give is my
flesh, for the life of the world." Where to find it?

There is an institution on the face of the earth that claims to possess all these things, and to those who have knocked at its portals and have asked for a drink has come the elixir of divine life and, with it, the peace
that comes to those who drink and never thirst again, and eat and never hunger again.

To each and every one of us, inside and outside the Church, our Lord asks, “Will you accept the cup of my love?" He took our cup of hate and bitterness in Gethsemane, and its dregs were so bitter that they made
Him cry out, "My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me."

But He drank every drop of it. If He drank our cup of hates, why do we not drink His chalice of pardon? Why, then, when He cries, "I thirst," do we give Him vinegar and gall?
