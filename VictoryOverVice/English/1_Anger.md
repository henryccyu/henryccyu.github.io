## First Word: Anger
> "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
>
> -- Luke 23:34

The one passion in man that has deeper roots in his rational nature than any other is the passion of anger. Anger and reason are capable of great compatibility, because anger is based upon reason, which weighs
the injury done and the satisfaction to be demanded. We are never angry unless someone has injured us in some way — or we think he has.

But not all anger is sinful, for there is such a thing as just anger. The most perfect expression of just anger we find in our blessed Lord's cleansing the Temple. Passing through its shadowed doorways at the festival
of the Pasch, He found greedy traders, victimizing at every turn the worshipers who needed lambs and doves for the Temple sacrifices.

Making a scourge of little cords, He moved through their midst with a calm dignity and beautiful self-control even more compelling than the whip. The oxen and sheep He drove out with His scourge. With His
hands, He upset the tables of the money-changers, who scrambled on the floor after their rolling coins. With His finger, He pointed to the vendors of doves and bade them leave the outer court. To all He said, "Take
these things hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic."

Here was fulfilled the injunction of the Scriptures, "Be angry, and sin not," for anger is no sin under three conditions: if the cause of anger is just, for example, defense of God's honor; if it is no greater than the
cause demands, that is, if it is kept under control; and if it is quickly subdued: "Let not the sun go down upon your anger."

Here we are not concerned with just anger, but with unjust anger, namely, that which has no rightful cause-anger that is excessive, revengeful, and enduring; the kind of anger and hatred against God that has
destroyed religion on one-sixth of the earth's surface; the kind of hatred that is not only directed against God, but also against fellowmen, and is fanned by the disciples of class conflict who talk peace but glory in
war; the red anger that rushes the blood to the surface, and the white anger that pushes it to the depths and bleaches the face; the anger that seeks to get even, to repay in kind, bump for bump, punch for punch,
eye for eye, lie for lie; the anger of the clenched fist prepared to strike, not in defense of that which is loved, but in offense against that which is hated; in a word, the kind of anger that will destroy our civilization
unless we smother it by love.

Our blessed Lord came to make reparation for the sin of anger, first by teaching us a prayer: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us"; and then by giving us a precept: "Love your
enemies; do good to them that hate you." More concretely still, He added, "Whosoever will force thee one mile, go with him another two.... If a man... take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto him."

Revenge and retaliation were forbidden: "You have heard that it has been said: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say unto you, love your enemies." These precepts were made all the more striking
because our Lord practiced them.

When the Gerasenes became angry at Him because He put a higher value on an afflicted man than on a herd of swine, Scripture records no retort: "And entering into the boat, He passed over the water." To the
soldier who struck Him with a mailed fist, He meekly responded "If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil, but if well, why strikest thou me?"

The perfect reparation for anger was made on Calvary. We might also say that anger and hate led our Lord up that hill. His own people hated Him, for they asked for His crucifixion; the law hated Him, for it
forsook justice to condemn Justice; the Gentiles hated Him, for they consented to His death; the forests hated Him for one of its trees bore the burden of His weight; the flowers hated Him as they wove thorns for
His brow; the bowels of the earth hated Him as it gave its steel as hammer and nails.

Then, as if to personalize all that hatred, the first generation of clenched fists in the history of the world stood beneath the Cross and shook them in the face of God. Even today, the hearts of their descendants
freeze into fists.

As we contemplate those clenched fists, we cannot help but feel that if ever anger would have been justified, if ever Justice might have fittingly judged, if ever Power might have rightfully struck, if ever Innocence
might have lawfully protested, if ever God might have justly revenged Himself against man—it was at that moment.

And yet, just at that second when a sickle and a hammer combined to cut down the grass on Calvary's hill to erect a cross, and drive nails through hands to render impotent the blessings of Love incarnate, He,
like a tree that bathes in perfume the axe that kills it, lets fall from His lips for the earth's first hearing the perfect reparation for anger and hate: a prayer for the army of clenched fists, the first Word from the Cross:
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

The greatest sinner may now be saved; the blackest sin may now be blotted out; the clenched fist may now be opened; the unforgivable may now be forgiven. While they were most certain that they knew what
they were doing, He seizes upon the only possible palliation of their crime and urges it upon His heavenly Father with all the ardor of a merciful Heart: ignorance-"They know not what they do." If they did know
what they were doing as they fastened Love to a tree, and still went on doing it, they would never be saved. They would be damned.

It is only because fists are clenched in ignorance that they may yet be opened into folded hands; it is only because tongues blaspheme in ignorance that they may yet speak in prayer. It is not their conscious
wisdom that saves them; it is their unconscious ignorance.

This Word from the Cross teaches us two lessons: the reason for forgiving is ignorance; and there are no limits to forgiveness.

The reason for forgiving is ignorance. Divine Innocence found such a reason for pardon; certainly guilt can do no less. St. Peter's first Pentecost sermon used this very excuse of ignorance for the Crucifixion so
fresh in his mind: "The author of life you killed... and now, brethren, I know that you did it through ignorance, as did also your rulers."

If there were full consciousness of the evil, perfect deliberation, perfect understanding of the consequences of acts, there would be no room for forgiveness. That is why there is no redemption for the fallen
angels. They knew what they were doing. We do not. We are very ignorant — ignorant of ourselves and ignorant of others.

Ignorant of others! How little we know of their motives, their good faith, the circumstances surrounding their actions. When others visit violence upon us, we, too, often forget how little we know about their
hearts and say, "I cannot see that they have the slightest excuse; they knew very well what they were doing." And yet in exactly the same circumstances, Jesus found an excuse: "They know not what they do."

We know nothing about the inside of our neighbor's heart, and hence, we refuse to forgive. Jesus knew the heart inside out, and because He did know, He forgave. Take any scene of action, let five people look upon
it, and you will get five different stories of what happened. No one of them sees all sides. Our Lord does, and that is why He forgives.

Why is it that we can find excuses for our anger against our neighbor, yet we refuse to admit the same excuses when our neighbor is angry with us? We say others would forgive us if they understood us perfectly,
and that the only reason they are angry with us is because "they do not understand.”

Why is not that ignorance reversible? Can we not be as ignorant of their motives, as we say they are ignorant of ours? Does not our refusal to find an excuse for their hatred tacitly mean that, under similar
circumstances, we ourselves will be unfit to be forgiven?

Ignorance of ourselves is another reason for forgiving others. Unfortunately it is ourselves we know least; our neighbor's sins, weaknesses, and failures we know a thousand times better than our own. Criticism
of others may be bad, but it is want of self-criticism which is worse.

It would be less wrong to criticize others if we first criticized ourselves, for if we first turned the searchlight on our own souls, we would never feel we had a right to turn it on the soul of anyone else. It is only
because we are ignorant of our true condition that we fail to realize how badly we stand in need of pardon.

Have we ever offended God? Has He any right to be angry with us? Then why should we, who need pardon so badly, strive not to purchase it by pardoning others? The answer is because we never examine our
own consciences.

We are so ignorant of our true condition that we know little more of ourselves than our name and address and how much we have; of our selfishness, our envy, our detraction, our sin, we know absolutely
nothing. In fact, in order that we may never know ourselves, we hate silence and solitariness. Lest our conscience should carry on with us an unbearable repartee, we drown out its voice in amusements,
distractions, and noise. If we met ourselves in others, we would hate them.

If we knew ourselves better, we would be more forgiving of others. The harder we are on ourselves, the easier we will be on others. The man who has never learned to obey knows not how to command, and the
man who has never disciplined himself knows not how to be merciful.

It is always the selfish who are unkind to others, and those who are hardest on themselves are the kindest to others, as the teacher who knows the least is always the most intolerant to his pupils.
Only a Lord who thought so little of Himself as to become man and die like a criminal could ever forgive the weakness of those who crucified Him.

It is not hatred that is wrong; it is hating the wrong thing that is wrong. It is not anger that is wrong; it is being angry at the wrong thing that is wrong. Tell me your enemy, and I will tell you what you are. Tell
me your hatred, and I will tell you your character.

Do you hate religion? Then your conscience bothers you. Do you hate the wealthy? Then you are avaricious, and you want to be wealthy. Do you hate the common worker? Then you are selfish and a snob. Do
you hate sin? Then you love God. Do you hate your hate, your selfishness, your quick temper, your wickedness? Then you are a good soul, for "If any man come to me... and hate not his own life, he cannot be my
disciple."

The second lesson to be derived from this First Word from the Cross is that there is no limit to pardon. Our Lord forgave when He was innocent and not because He Himself had been forgiven. Hence, we must
forgive not only when we have been forgiven, but even when we are innocent.

The problem of the limits of pardon once troubled Peter, and he asked our Lord: "How often shall my brother offend against me, and I forgive him-till seven times?" Peter thought he was stretching forgiveness
by saying "seven times," for it was four more than the Jewish Masters enjoined.

Peter proposed a limit beyond which there was to be no forgiveness. He assumed the right to be forgiven is automatically renounced after seven offenses. It is equivalent to saying, "I renounce my right to collect
debts from you if you never owe me more than seven dollars, but if you exceed that sum, then my duty of further cancellation ceases. I can throttle you for eight dollars."

Our Lord, in answering Peter, says that forgiveness has no limits; forgiveness is the surrender of all rights and the denial of limits. "I say not to thee till seven times but till seventy times seven." That does not
mean 490 literally, but infinitely. The Savior then proceeded to tell the parable of the unjust steward who, immediately after being forgiven by his lord a debt of ten thousand talents, choked a fellow servant who
owed him a hundred pence. The unmerciful steward, by refusing to be merciful to his debtor, had his own mercy revoked. His guilt was not that, needing mercy, he refused to show it, but having received mercy,
he was unmerciful still. "So also shall my heavenly Father do to you if you forgive not every one his brother."

Forgive then, and we will be forgiven. Remit our anger against others, and God will remit His anger against us. Judgment is a harvest where we sow what we reap. If we sowed anger against our brethren during
life, we will reap the just anger of God. Judge not, and we shall not be judged.

If, during life, we forgive others from our hearts, on Judgment Day the all-wise God will permit something very unusual to Himself: He will forget how to add and will know only how to subtract. He who has a
memory from all eternity will no longer remember our sins. Thus, we will be saved once again through divine "ignorance."

If we forgive others on the ground that they know not what they do, our Lord will forgive us on the ground that He no longer remembers what we did. It may well be that if He looks on a hand that now, after
hearing the first Word on the Cross, gives a kindly blessing to an enemy, He will even forget that it was once a clenched fist red with the blood of Christendom.
