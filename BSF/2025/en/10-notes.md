# The Return to Rebuild

**Lesson 10 Notes: Ezra 3–6**

## Rebuilding the Temple – Ezra 3

Due to persistent sin, Jerusalem and the temple had been destroyed and the Israelites scattered. The books of Ezra (Lessons 9-12) and Nehemiah (Lessons 23-27) show us how God intervened to recover what sin had stolen. The exiles returned to rebuild their homeland, and God restored the temple and prescribed worship expected of His covenant people. Though believers will continue to fail, God steadfastly upholds His promises, never abandoning His people or the commitments He has made to them. For those who belong to God, disobedience brings discipline but not disqualification. Ultimately, faithfulness to God requires the internal transformation Jeremiah and Ezekiel prophesied.[^1] The Son of God would take on flesh to redeem a people for God from every tribe and nation. God’s own Spirit would accomplish within broken people what their human efforts could not. Jesus’s teaching parallels and confirms these coming events.[^2]

### Focus Verse

> “For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.” (Ezra 6:22)

### Outline

- Rebuilding the Temple – Ezra 3
- Resisting Opposition – Ezra 4:1–6:12
- Resuming Worship – Ezra 6:13-22

### Engage

Worship is the appropriate posture of all people before their Creator. A proper view of self and of God makes humility, surrender, and gratitude the only acceptable response to Him. Since humanity’s fall into sin,[^3] people have naturally opposed God, foolishly elevating themselves. Satan, full of fury against God, fuels rebellion and opposes everything that honors Him. Full of grace for the wayward, God makes a way for sinners to seek Him. Only then do the people God created find their purpose and flourish.

God called exiled individuals and families in Babylon to return to the wrecked temple in Jerusalem, where they would rebuild what their enemies had destroyed. They sought to restore not only a physical structure but to reinstitute the rightful worship God deserved, desired, and commanded. Their efforts to worship God met fierce opposition. Worship of the one true God threatens earthly strongholds. The enemies of God fight against the worship of God. Opponents of the exiles attacked their efforts in a variety of ways. In the same way, our submission to God will always meet pushback. God enables His people to worship Him, despite opposition. We worship God because He alone is worthy.

## The Rebuilt Altar and Feast of Tabernacles – 3:1-6

With the returning Israelites settled in their hometowns, the leaders of the expedition focused their first efforts on the spiritual welfare of the people. The seventh month of the Hebrew calendar includes several sacred feasts.[^4] Therefore, the foremost order of business for the priest Joshua and leader Zerubbabel was to rebuild the altar, which represented the very heart of Israel’s worship. Before its destruction, the Jerusalem temple had been the site of reconciliation for sinful people who humbled themselves before their holy God. God’s law instructed His people to confess their sin and seek atonement by offering animal sacrifices. With the altar reconstructed, sacrifices could be reinstated and the annual sacred feasts celebrated. This had not happened for 70 years.

The restoration of God’s people depended upon the renewal of obedient worship offered to their faithful God. Acceptable worship requires sacrifice for sin. This is true in both the Old Testament’s symbolic sacrifices and Christ’s ultimate sacrifice to which all the slain animals pointed. Overcoming fear of their neighbors, the people gathered in Jerusalem to offer burnt offerings on the newly rebuilt altar. They began to offer sacrifices in the morning and evening on the first day of the seventh month. The returnees also kept the Feast of Tabernacles, as God had commanded.

## The Temple Foundation – 3:7-11

The returned exiles contributed money and goods to fund the skilled laborers and supplies needed to rebuild the temple. Logs were brought from the Phoenician coastal cities of Tyre and Sidon[^5] to Joppa, a seaport about 35 miles (56 km) from Jerusalem. Zerubbabel, Joshua, and all the men who had returned with them began work on the temple itself in the second month of the second year of their return (537 BC). This was the same springtime date on which Solomon began building the First Temple.[^6]

Celebrations erupted when the temple’s foundation had been laid. Following David’s example of praising God with joyful fanfare, priests in fine apparel played trumpets alongside Levites striking cymbals. With thanksgiving, the people sang to the Lord, “He is good; his love toward Israel endures forever.” The grateful people affirmed God’s immovable love for them with great shouts of praise.

## Celebrating and Weeping – 3:12-13

Different generations brought varying perspectives to this momentous celebration. Some of the older people who were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon remembered the former glory of Solomon’s Temple and their beloved but now decimated city. They wept as they looked at the new foundation laid among the ruins. Shouts of joy and sounds of weeping mixed indistinguishably among the people. Sin had taken them to Babylon; God’s grace returned them to Jerusalem. Psalm 126 vividly captures the intensity of emotions experienced by the exiles amid their returning, rebuilding, and restoration: “When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed. Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. … Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.”

God brings restoration, hope, and joy from the ashes of sin’s destruction. Isaiah wrote, “The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives … to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion—to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.”[^7] As believers, we can simultaneously weep and worship. Only God can restore what sin has destroyed.

## Dying for the Sake of Another: The Doctrine of Substitution

God gave Israel a tangible way to understand the gravity of their sin and His plan to deal with sin’s penalty on their behalf. By God’s design, a system of animal sacrifices taught His people something important. Sin is costly, even to the point of death. The slain animals did not save them but symbolically represented what God would do in the future, a plan more clearly understood through Isaiah 53. Ultimately, the sacrifices that the Israelites practiced, and Zerubbabel and Joshua reinstated, anticipated the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ.[^8] God’s own Son died as a substitute for all who place their faith in His atoning sacrifice.

Jesus Christ, the sinless Lamb of God, stood in the place of sinners, bearing the full force of God’s wrath against humanity’s sin.[^9] With Jesus as their substitute, believers stand before God not covered in sin but fully clothed in Christ’s righteousness.[^10] Everyone who looks to Christ for salvation receives forgiveness of sin and the power to live a redeemed, transformed life.[^11]

Unless Jesus stands as your substitute before God, you carry the weight of God’s just wrath against your sin. There is nothing you can offer God that sufficiently meets the righteous standards He requires. Without Jesus’s death in your place, you face life without hope, eternally separated from God. Without Jesus as your substitute, you are not prepared to meet God. But meet Him you will, in judgment and condemnation.

Thankfully, Jesus demonstrated His love by dying in the place of all who receive His gift of salvation. His perfect sacrifice as the unblemished Passover Lamb satisfied God’s righteous requirements. He took our sin so He could offer us His unblemished righteousness in its place. With Jesus as your substitute, when God looks at you He sees only Christ’s perfection. Jesus took upon Himself the punishment He did not deserve to offer us righteousness we could not earn.

## Resisting Opposition – Ezra 4:1–6:12

Ezra chronicled the resistance to rebuilding in Jerusalem that occurred over many decades, extending through the entire time of Nehemiah. He recorded various forms of opposition but not in chronological order. To help alleviate confusion in our study of these events, we will walk through this segment chronologically, as history unfolded:

- **Ezra 4:1-5, 24** — Opposition began shortly after the first return under Zerubbabel, during the reigns of Cyrus (539-530 BC) and Darius (522-486 BC).
- **Ezra 5:1–6:12** — More opposition occurred during the time of Darius, Zerubbabel, and Joshua. God intervened through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. Darius officially authorized continuation of the work on the temple toward its eventual completion.
- **Ezra 4:6-23** — Opposition occurred during the reigns of Xerxes (486-464 BC) and Artaxerxes (464-423 BC) against the rebuilding of the city wall, which left the completed temple unprotected. These events coincide with events in Nehemiah.

Ezra likely grouped the waves of opposition to reveal the long-term, multigenerational struggles God’s people faced. All three waves of returnees encountered resistance to the project God called them to complete. Ezra 1–6 records the opposition of outsiders against the Israelites’ efforts, while Ezra 7–10 records internal struggles that challenged the restoration. The book of Nehemiah carries this theme forward through the rebuilding of the city and its walls.

### Rising Challenges under Zerubbabel’s Leadership – 4:1-5, 24

The Bible records consistent opposition to God and His people. Ezra’s account points to the spiritual struggle believers face in a fallen world to this very day. Unsurprisingly, the pioneering builders encountered adversaries from among the people who had inhabited Palestine during the exile. After the Assyrians invaded Israel and deported most of the Israelites, imported foreigners occupied the towns of Samaria, intermarrying with Hebrews and creating a hybrid people, culture, and religion.[^12] The Samaritans and Israelites maintained a deep rivalry for generations.

God’s enemies often stage attacks on God’s people in subtle, covert ways. Claiming allegiance to their God, Israel’s enemies slyly offered to join efforts with the Israelites. Zerubbabel resoundingly and wisely refused. He recognized the practical and spiritual dangers this potential alliance would have posed. When their offer of help failed, the enemies’ true intentions surfaced. These foes sought to control the situation, discourage the Israelites, and stop progress. They even hired counselors to help them maximize this frustration.

People who honor and work for God can fall prey to despair when opposition arises. As human beings with limited strength, we can give way to fear and doubt when our forward steps become difficult. Ezra 4:24 tells us that these enemies succeeded in stalling progress on the temple until the second year of Darius, king of Persia. Though Israel’s detractors initially seemed to succeed, God’s people and purpose ultimately prevailed.

### Joshua and Zerubbabel Overcame Challenges – 5:1–6:12

**God Sent His Prophets (5:1-2)** — Despite the delay after the temple foundation had been laid, God continued to work. In timely ways throughout Israel’s history, God appointed human voices to speak His message. For this season, God raised up two prophets—Haggai and Zechariah—to rebuke and exhort His people. Haggai began to speak to the people 16 years after work to rebuild the temple first began (520 BC).[^13] Zechariah began his prophetic work two months later, calling the people to return to the Lord.[^14] These two men supported Zerubbabel and Joshua, who are memorialized in some of Zechariah’s most glorious prophetic visions.[^15] We will consider the books of both prophets later in this study. Strengthened by God’s prophets, Joshua and Zerubbabel resumed the work to rebuild the temple.

**Ongoing Opposition during the Time of Darius (5:3–6:12)** — The book of Ezra includes official correspondence documenting the political and practical obstacles God’s people encountered. Chapter 5 includes a letter to King Darius from Tattenai, the regional governor, questioning whether the Israelites had official authorization for their project. He repeated the Israelites’ claim of Cyrus’s decree and asked that court records be searched to validate that fact. In yet another demonstration of God’s overruling sovereignty, Darius responded in favor of the Jews. Not only did he order the Trans-Euphrates officials to stop hindering the work, he also commanded the royal treasury to fund rebuilding efforts. Darius even threatened to destroy anyone who impeded the temple rebuild. God’s remarkable intervention and provision steadied His people to finish their appointed labor.

### Ongoing Challenges Faced Later by Nehemiah – 4:6-23

Ezra offers examples of the opposition repeatedly faced by the Israelites throughout their God-given mission to restore Judah and Jerusalem. Jumping back in this week’s Scripture passage, the remainder of chapter 4 contains official communication sent between Israel’s adversaries and the Persian rulers Xerxes and Artaxerxes. This correspondence relates to the ongoing conflict recorded in Nehemiah as he attempted to rebuild Jerusalem’s city walls and gates. Interestingly, these letters were originally written in Aramaic, the language used in diplomatic matters, and translated into Hebrew.[^16]

A commander named Rehum represented the peoples who settled in the land following the Assyrian conquest of Israel. Citing the Israelites’ documented history of rebellion and evil, he disparaged the nation. Rehum listed the economic and political losses the king would suffer if the Israelites succeeded in rebuilding the city of Jerusalem. Artaxerxes succumbed to Rehum’s arguments and commanded that the Israelites cease all rebuilding work. Confronting the workers with a show of force, he successfully halted progress for 16 years. The enemy accused the Israelites of former sins, adding an element of truth to his well-orchestrated lies. These strategically aimed words and physical threats hit their intended mark. All labor on the city of Jerusalem stalled. Nehemiah later grieved over Jerusalem’s rubble and the abandoned endeavor.[^17] But God was not finished.

## Resuming Worship – Ezra 6:13-22

### The Temple Completed and Dedicated – 6:13-18

Before the 16-year pause, and greatly encouraged by Darius’s published support of completing the temple, the leader Zerubbabel, the priest Joshua, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, and the returned Jewish remnant worked as a team to complete Israel’s second temple in 515 BC. Leaping ahead into chapter 6, Ezra records the significant date of the temple’s completion—“on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.” This completed task represented not just collaborative human effort but God’s blessing upon the people for obeying His commands.

The people celebrated with overflowing joy as the restored temple was dedicated. This time, there were no tears. They offered sacrifices: 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and, as a sin offering, 12 male goats. Priests and Levites were assigned to positions of service, as dictated by the law of Moses.[^18]

### Passover Celebrated – 6:19-22

With intentional obedience, the returned Israelites gathered to celebrate Passover as God had prescribed.[^19] Some of the people living within the land joined the Israelites in celebration and worship, having turned away from idolatry and other sins that polluted their lives. Crossing the boundaries of race and heredity, God united people who were committed to seeking Him and living holy and separated lives.

God’s people also celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Verse 22 indicates they attributed the joy they experienced to God’s sovereignty in turning the heart of Assyria’s king in their favor. The returned Israelites knew they completed God’s appointed task not by human strength or wisdom but because God’s hand was upon them.

God restored His people to Himself and led them to worship as He had commanded. He provided for them to reinstate the worship practices their 70-year exile had diminished. God, who took His people into physical exile, delivered them out of spiritual exile. The rebuilding of the temple and reinstatement of sacrifices and festivals involved far more than stacking bricks and resetting calendars. God had always desired heartfelt worship from His people, not just external compliance to His laws.

God is not like us; His demand for worship is not self-serving. Surrendering to God and living in communion with Him is the highest calling and greatest blessing we can experience. God always has our best interests in His heart. Wholehearted surrender and careful obedience to God strikes a blow at the sinful, self-oriented posture our fallen hearts prefer. Serving and honoring God also means resisting external pressures and enemies who oppose God and His people. True worship of God will always meet opposition in this world. To stand with God means trusting Him to mold our hearts to His purposes. He equips us to do what He commands. We can only do this in His strength—not our own. God enables His people to worship Him, despite opposition.

## Take to Heart

### Hold Fast

Ezra recorded the plight of the first group of exiles to return to Jerusalem. Focused on restoring the worship God intended for His people, the returnees began their work by rebuilding the altar and laying the foundation of the temple. With the place of sacrifice rebuilt amid Jerusalem’s rubble, the people rejoiced at this progress but also grieved their losses.

The surrounding people soon organized to oppose the Israelites’ efforts. With a variety of tactics and various official correspondences, these enemies initially succeeded in stopping progress on the temple. Ezra carefully chronicled this pattern of resistance that persisted throughout the entire process of rebuilding the temple and the city and its walls. However, in the end, God intervened on behalf of His people, leading King Darius to thwart the opposition and bankroll the project. By God’s hand, the temple was completed and dedicated. The people rejoiced greatly as they celebrated Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. God called His people not only to return to the land but to overcome resistance and reestablish the worship He had prescribed.

### Apply It

God called Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the returning band of Israelites to a formidable task, by human estimation. A difficult journey to a decimated city brought steep challenges, despite God’s clear mandate and provision. How do you decide what to tackle first when you face a monumental task? Zerubbabel and Joshua rightly prioritized Israel’s worship. For 70 years, these exiles had been unable to worship God in the way He had ordained and the place they cherished. These wise leaders allowed spiritual priorities to dictate their practical work list, first rebuilding the crushed altar and the temple’s foundation. You also face many duties that require your attention and labor. Jobs, parenting, marriage, and daily survival require applying ourselves to routine tasks and long-term goals. How do you decide where to apply your primary focus and efforts? Spiritual priorities can permeate and undergird seemingly mundane tasks and daily decisions. What priority is driving your work this week? By His grace, God leads His people through necessary work in ways that honor Him.

We sometimes think obeying God means smooth sailing and uninterrupted peace. This optimistic idea does not hold true in real life or reflect the Scriptures. The returning exiles arrived safely and purposefully began their important work. However, almost as soon as the priests ignited the coals on the freshly built altar, their enemies circled and conspired against their progress. God allows challenges along our path to ultimate victory. Difficult days reveal many integral truths. Important work requires diligence. The most important things in life often come with struggle. God uses obstacles and opposition to develop our character, grow our faith, and prove His faithfulness. The path God ordains is one His enemy opposes.[^20] Have you discovered that obeying God brings more challenges than you expected? How do you respond to opposition and obstacles? If your path of obedience has become unexpectedly difficult, what are you learning? What promise of God holds you secure when your enemies block your path? God is worthy of our trust, on good days and through hard seasons.

As believers, we view our lives in the middle of the story. We can rejoice that God called us to salvation in Christ. One day, we will be done with sin, conquer death, and spend eternity in God’s presence. Hallelujah! However, today is messy. Do you ever feel the road is too long and your faith too weak to finish unscathed? Good news! Finishing strong does not depend on us. God works within His people to accomplish all that obedience requires. Paul wrote in Philippians 1:6: “Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.” Zerubbabel and his team celebrated the completed temple. And one day, every believer will stand in God’s presence only because Christ made it happen. Certainly, God calls us to apply our human strength to following Jesus, seeking Him, and growing in practical righteousness. But we accomplish nothing of eternal value in our own strength. The certainty of the glorious finale of a believer’s story offers hope while the battle rages. How will you find hope and confidence in the middle of your faith story?

Zerubbabel and Joshua rightly recognized the importance of worshipping God. Worship involves much more than singing and going to church. We worship God when we yield our very lives to Him. This happens a thousand ways on all kinds of days. We worship God by thinking about who He is and living under that truth. We worship God when honoring Him matters more than pleasing ourselves. We worship God when His character is reflected in our lives. We worship God when His greatness puts lesser pursuits and discouraging obstacles into proper perspective. Worshipping God is a believer’s priority. How will you align your life, your week, and your days on earth to make humble surrender to God your passionate desire?
