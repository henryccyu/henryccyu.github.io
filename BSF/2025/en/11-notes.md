# New Beginnings in the Promised Land

## Lesson 11 Notes: Ezra 7–8

### The Decree – Ezra 7

God fulfilled His promises by launching three groups of Israelites to leave exile in Babylon and return to Judah and Jerusalem.

- **Ezra 1–6** documents the first return led by Zerubbabel and Joshua. They overcame opposition to rebuild the altar and temple. They reestablished God-ordained sacrifices and feast days.
- **Ezra 7–10** records the second return, led by Ezra himself. He focused on leading God’s people to consecrate themselves before God and align themselves with His truth.
- **Nehemiah** led the third group to overcome the ploys of persistent enemies and fortify Jerusalem’s wall.

### Focus Verse

> “For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the Lord, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.” (Ezra 7:10)

### Outline

- The Decree – Ezra 7

## Engage

God is self-existent. His nature and worth do not depend on anything outside Himself. He does not need us in any way. Yet in amazing mercy and grace, God has revealed Himself to humanity, not just through His wondrous creation but with actual words. The Bible represents an extraordinary gift from God to the people He created. No matter how much Scripture we know or how many Bibles we own, we must not take God’s divine provision for granted. God tells us what He is like, what is true, how we can know Him, and how we should live. We do well to listen, surrender, and obey.

Ezra’s book records the first two groups of God’s people who returned to reclaim their homeland. Ezra’s leadership encompassed much more than leading a band of pilgrims to accomplish an appointed task. A true spiritual leader, Ezra’s commitment to God and His law fueled his mission and methods. Personally devoted to studying God’s Word and teaching God’s truths to others, Ezra led the people to seek, obey, and worship God. Ezra revered God and surrendered to His ways, deeply aware of God’s intervention and provision. God’s Word guides and guards His people’s commitment to Him. The God of eternity speaks to ordinary people through His extraordinary Word.

God charted the course for His people and raised up the right leaders for the right tasks at the right time. The people’s return to reinhabit the promised land after their exile demonstrates God’s faithfulness to His promises and sovereign plan. Throughout history, God has always desired heartfelt worship by His people, not merely external compliance to rules. Ezra called the people to obedience but also recognized God as worthy of their wholehearted worship and focus.

### Ezra’s Lineage – 7:1-5

God propelled Ezra into leadership during the reign of the Persian King Artaxerxes, around 458 BC, about 80 years after the first return under Zerubbabel and 57 years after the temple dedication.[^1] Ezra’s priestly lineage traced back to Aaron, Israel’s first high priest and Moses’s brother.[^2] God’s law dictated that priests descend from Aaron. Yet this privileged calling did not imply an elevated worthiness before God. Aaron himself grievously sinned when he fashioned a golden calf for the people in the wilderness.[^3] Aaron, Ezra, and all who physically qualified as Israel’s priests needed God’s redemption along with the people they led. However, the preservation of the Aaronic priesthood marks God’s faithfulness to provide spiritual leaders for His people and uphold the Mosaic law.[^4]

### Ezra’s Return – 7:6b-9

God confirmed the burden He gave Ezra by moving King Artaxerxes to support his plan. The king granted Ezra everything he asked, not because of Ezra’s eloquence or passion, but because the Lord’s hand was upon His servant. Ezra assembled Israelites, priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, and temple servants to return with him to Jerusalem. The composition of the returning group attests to Ezra’s focus on restoring the spiritual life of His people.

### Ezra’s Priority – 7:6a, 10

Ezra’s qualifications as Israel’s spiritual leader included more than his bloodline. He served as a teacher of the law of Moses—well-versed in the priorities and practices God designed for Israel’s worship. Even while in exile, Ezra saturated himself in the Old Testament Scriptures. Not only did God’s laws frame Ezra’s own life and thinking, but he also “devoted himself” to teaching God’s laws to His people. When God’s Word frames our thinking, His ways will naturally mold our priorities and impact on others.

Physical tasks and daily responsibilities need not be separated from spiritual priorities. Ezra certainly attended to practical matters such as planning, packing, and preparing for the 900-mile (about 1,500 km) journey with a band of pioneers. However, Ezra’s commitment to God and His Word undergirded his decisions and duties. Ezra’s story details his passion to lead people to honor and worship God.

### Ezra’s Authority – 7:11-26

God confirmed Ezra’s divine commission with a royal decree. King Artaxerxes shared Ezra’s determination with full sympathy and financial support. The king’s royal decree offered an open invitation for any Israelite in his kingdom to join Ezra and return to their homeland. Artaxerxes commissioned Ezra to discern the state of Judah and Jerusalem in accordance with God’s law.

## The Significance of God’s Word

### The Doctrine of the Bible

Have you ever considered how God has drawn you to this Bible study? Every week, you can open God’s Word to study and apply what you learn in powerful and practical ways. God gave us His Word, revealing Himself and everything He knows that we need to know. We seldom adequately marvel at this profound privilege. Through God’s Word, we understand something of God’s nature, character, and sovereign plan for human history. We learn how sin sabotaged humanity and how God sacrificed His Son to redeem what sin had stolen. The Bible teaches us that history is moving on the course God has designed toward a final victory He will accomplish. And if that were not enough, God gives His Spirit to live within believers, illuminating their minds to understand and believe His truth. The Bible is truly a treasure book, given by God to us.

Unlike any other book we can hold, the Bible contains divine revelation that God’s Spirit delivered through more than 40 human authors.[^5] Because the Bible reveals God-generated truth, it is fully trustworthy and without error in its original documents.[^6] The Bible stands on eternal truth, which cannot change.[^7] By the Spirit’s power, Scripture pierces the human heart, unmasking our sinfulness and need for God.[^8] More than a record of facts, the Bible contains life-giving truth and trustworthy promises[^9] that offer hope and stability to God’s people.

Without eyes fixed on the Bible as our standard, we are left to make sense of life based on the wavering whims of our time-bound, earth-oriented understanding. If we do not look to our Creator to define what is true and yield to His authority, we rely only on human assets, which prove limited and wanting. If we view the Bible as a dusty book that only applies to weak and culturally irrelevant people, we will fail to know God as He truly is. Ignoring or rejecting the Bible means missing life’s treasure of eternal truth and facing forever without hope.

In His Word, God gave us a lamp for our feet and a light for our path.[^10] The Holy Spirit takes biblical truths and unlocks our minds to understand what human wisdom alone cannot grasp. God’s Word provides fresh food for our hungry souls, speaking to our greatest needs and satisfying our deepest longings. The Bible reflects God’s infinite nature—a lifetime of study cannot exhaust the riches within God’s beautiful Word. Knowing God’s Word helps us recognize Satan’s lies and this world’s errors.[^11] God’s Word speaks with simultaneous simplicity, clarity, and depth that we can teach to infants but also ponder until our last breath. Heaven and earth will pass away, but God’s Word abides forever.[^12]

**What does God’s Word mean to you?**

-----

Ezra carried money that the king and his people contributed to fund the sacrifices God required in the Jerusalem temple. The decree also allowed discretionary use of any additional funds. This official edict communicated a call to diligent work, faithfulness to “the God of heaven,” and the king’s fear of God’s wrath should his dynasty hinder the work in any way. Artaxerxes also instructed Ezra to appoint judges to enforce both the laws of God and the king. The king gave Ezra authority to allow those who served in the temple to forgo taxation. He also permitted Ezra to punish rebels by death, banishment, confiscation of their property, and imprisonment.

The king’s edict recognized Ezra as “the priest, a teacher of the Law, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the Lord for Israel.” How did an exiled priest influence this powerful earthly king? Ezra, without question, leaned on God’s wisdom, not his own. The faithfulness God birthed and bolstered within Ezra reaped amazing outcomes. Ultimately, God Himself set His favor upon Ezra and his efforts. God equips people who faithfully study and obey His Word to impact the world in remarkable ways.

### Ezra’s Gratitude – 7:27-28

Ezra did not attribute the king’s abundant blessing and support to his own passionate words and efforts. He did not point to cunning strategy or careful planning to explain what had happened. With a humble and grateful posture, Ezra praised God for every blessing he now recalled.

Despite an undoubtedly long work list, Ezra stopped to speak grateful words to the praiseworthy God of his ancestors. First, he exalted God for moving the king’s heart to honor the Jerusalem temple. Ezra understood the temple’s pivotal role at the heart of Israel’s worship. Second, he recognized that God had granted the favor of the king and his advisors. Third, he acknowledged his own inner fortitude and courage as the work of God, not human boldness. God’s hand truly rested on Ezra.

God’s people study His Word to know God and live in a way that honors Him. They seek His guidance through prayer. When God does what only God can do, we should take notice. Ezra used words to express all that God had done, and so should people today. The God who moved the heart of this king still works on behalf of His people. Praising God for matters big and small prepares God’s people to recognize their dependence on Him, acknowledge His goodness, and understand His power. The faithfulness of God propels the faithfulness of His people.

## The Departure – Ezra 8

Ezra offers details regarding the wave of returnees who journeyed with him. Individuals and families prepared to join those already living in Judah and Jerusalem. Ezra recorded the names of specific individuals as well as the number of unnamed men. His record demonstrates God’s presence and purpose through the details and people who made this trip from Babylon to Jerusalem.

### The People Who Journeyed – 8:1-14

Ezra recorded the genealogy of those who returned with him as a formal registration of the courageous band. The family heads are documented, listing first the priestly divisions born from Aaron’s sons: the descendants of Phineas, a son of Eleazar,[^13] and those of Ithamar.[^14] Ezra clearly sought to fortify the priesthood within Israel. The census of the returnees registers a noticeably smaller party than those who returned earlier with Zerubbabel. However, God entrusted this group with the sacred privilege of restoring temple worship in Jerusalem under the God-ordained leadership of Ezra, the priest.

### The Levites They Lacked – 8:15-20

This Jewish contingent followed the route their great ancestor Abraham traveled 1,400 years before. Early in the journey, Ezra assembled the group at the canal that flows toward Ahava, where they camped for three days. During this break in their travel, Ezra discovered that no Levites were among the travel party. Within the structure God ordained to support Israel’s worship, the Levites were designated to assist the priests at the temple. Ezra could not ignore this omission.

Why had the Levites not joined Ezra’s group voluntarily? Was life in exile more comfortable and familiar than the uncharted course faced by Ezra and his band of returnees? Ezra demonstrated courageous and wise leadership by recognizing and addressing this problem. Good leaders do not merely forge ahead but acknowledge and address any gaps that should not be overlooked.

Ezra realized that he needed the Levites to carry out his mission and restore Israel’s worship in Jerusalem. In response, he formed a delegation to carry a message to Iddo, a key leader in Kasiphia—evidently a place where Levites and temple servants lived. God moved in the heart of a capable man identified as Sherebiah, a descendant of Levi’s son Mahli,[^15] to enlist 18 from his family. Two other key leaders, Hashabiah and Jeshaiah, descendants of Merari,[^16] added 20 more. Ezra acknowledged God’s gracious provision as 38 Levites and 220 temple servants were registered and joined his assembled band of returnees. God would use this relatively small number of key men to mold the future of His people.

### The Prayers that Guided Them – 8:21-23

Ezra recognized the need for God’s power and provision for every step of their journey. The leaders God uses do not depend on their own strength and wisdom to move forward. In fact, dependence on God rises as the hallmark of godly leadership. Ezra wisely set aside time to call the people to humble themselves before God and seek His provision and protection.

Ezra realized the journey before them would be long and dangerous. The caravan route they would travel, beset with Bedouin raiders, posed a threat to the women, children, and goods in their care. Ezra took every sensible precaution to ensure careful stewardship of the people, money, and treasures. He planned and prepared, but he also prayed. Ezra led the people to fast, pray, and seek God for their safety and the protection of the resources entrusted to them.

When Ezra stood before the king, he had declared God’s faithfulness and the favor He bestows on those who seek Him. Led by God, he refused to tarnish that proclamation with a request for a military escort to provide human protection. We can relate to Ezra’s struggle between the reality that caused him fear and the theology he professed. He chose to live under the truth about God that he had boldly declared to the king. Ezra did not want to risk misrepresenting the God in whom the travelers would find ultimate security. When God answered this deliberate prayer with a safe journey, His people would recognize that God’s mighty hand delivered them to their destination.

### The Provision that Supported Them – 8:24-36

Ezra exercised zealous care to steward the riches dedicated to God and the temple. He did not take this responsibility lightly. He set apart 12 leading priests for this sacred task. The silver, gold, and precious articles were weighed and entrusted to these proven leaders for the journey. Ezra clearly communicated not just the value of the precious items given as freewill offerings to the Lord, but he also said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the Lord.” Those delegated with this important task bore responsibility for safely transporting the treasures dedicated to the Lord. Godly leaders remain accountable not just for their assigned duties but to God Himself. Faithfully stewarding the privileges and resources that God bestows represents a very high calling.

The divinely commissioned travel party set out for Jerusalem from Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month. Ezra led the returnees forward only when a sufficient representation of Levites joined their band and the entire group covered their journey in deliberate prayer. God protected them from enemies and bandits on their journey, and they arrived safely in Jerusalem four months later, where they rested for three days.

On their fourth day in Jerusalem, Ezra and the priests accounted for the silver, gold, and sacred treasures by number and weight. This official audit validated the faithfulness of these appointed servants and the provision of their faithful God. Those who genuinely serve God make every effort to uphold integrity before God and people.

The exiles who had now returned from captivity offered sacrifices to God and delivered the king’s edict to the governing officials in the region. The restored sacrifices represented their consecration before God and desire to worship Him as He ordained. Saturated in God’s Word, Ezra’s commitment to God and His ways clearly permeated his leadership. God led Ezra to seek God, to lead for His cause, and to call His people to worship Him rightly. God’s Word guides and guards His people’s commitment to Him. Believers today remain faithful, not because they are strong but because God is mighty. The Word of God leads the people of God to know how to live for Him, and His Spirit empowers them to do so.

## Take to Heart

### Hold Fast

God called Ezra, a priest descended from Aaron’s lineage, to lead a band of Israelites to return to Jerusalem and Judah. Even while in exile, Ezra diligently studied and sought to teach God’s laws to His people. Ezra’s saturation in God’s Word, will, and ways equipped him to lead exiles home—physically to Jerusalem and spiritually to reignited devotion, worship, and obedience. Ezra certainly demonstrated strong leadership and efficient planning, but his true success came because God’s hand was upon him. King Artaxerxes granted Ezra favor and support, issuing a royal decree of permission, financial support, and political protection for Ezra’s God-ordained mission.

Ezra carefully recorded the families who left exile with him. When Ezra determined that the Levites needed to serve in the Jerusalem temple had not joined the journey, he sent a delegation to rectify the problem. God brought key leaders and provided the Levites and temple servants needed to uphold this priority. Before the people embarked on their journey, Ezra led them to fast and pray, relying on God’s provision and protection rather than a military escort. He entrusted consecrated leaders to steward the dedicated gold, silver, and treasures. He validated that all those resources arrived as intended. Reinstating sacrifices and commitment to God’s Word, Ezra honored God by faithfully leading His people back to Jerusalem.

### Apply It

God’s Word did not grow deep roots in Ezra’s heart by chance. Ezra recognized the importance of God’s laws. He spent time and effort to know God’s Word deeply and teach it to others. How are you seeking to deepen your knowledge of God’s Word in a world full of competing loyalties? Spiritual disciplines reap life-altering results. A daily habit of studying God’s Word or commitment to memorizing Scripture does far more than fill our minds with words and facts. God molds our hearts to His when we dedicate ourselves to knowing the Scriptures. God’s Spirit unlocks His truth to transform our hearts and lives. Ezra sought to restore the worship of God’s people because he bowed before Israel’s God. In the same way, God will direct your heart and realign your life goals as you surrender your thoughts to His. Do you see Bible study as an obligatory task or a privilege and delight? How has God rewarded your diligent study of His Word?

Before the traveling Israelites left Ahava, they deliberately sought God’s protection and blessing. They recognized the dangers of their journey but did not shrink back in fear. Through fasting and deliberate prayer, they looked to God, not human strength, as their source of safety and security. Through prayer, believers acknowledge both their need and God’s sufficiency. When God answers prayers, He receives the glory, and our faith in Him grows. God listens when His people pray and He acts on their behalf. God may not always answer in the ways we expect, but the very practice of depending on Him through prayer trains our hearts to seek God and surrender to Him. What pressing need should you pour out to God today? How will you trust God to recognize your deepest needs and answer your prayers?

Ezra’s leadership incorporated practical wisdom alongside spiritual priorities. Entrusted by God with people and treasures, Ezra implemented rigorous measures to steward his God-given responsibilities wisely. He recognized the need for careful practices to hold people accountable, visibly validating honesty and integrity among the leaders. Ultimately, he called others to view their duties as unto God Himself. Churches, Christian organizations, governments, business, and family responsibilities should be stewarded in a way that honors God. Wise procedures and transparent governance ensure honesty, uphold God’s standards, and strengthen believers’ witness before a watching world. Serving God rightly is a spiritual matter with practical implications. Think about the leadership roles and responsibilities that God has entrusted to you. How do you consecrate your heart to God in these matters? Do you see your work first as unto the Lord and then to others? How do you honor God and align with the guiding principles of His Word in the details of your work for Him? God’s holiness motivates our faithfulness in serving Him and those under our care.

Ezra is deemed a great leader, but his success did not depend on his intelligence or strategy. God’s hand was on him when he made his request to King Artaxerxes. God’s hand was on him when the king’s edict paved the way for his journey and paid the bill. God’s hand was on him when Levites and temple servants joined the travelers and the people sought God in prayer. God’s hand was on him as the band of travelers arrived safely in Jerusalem with their treasures intact. God’s presence and blessing matter more than anything else this world offers. Do you recognize God’s hand in your life? Do you recognize God’s hand in the lives of those around you? Do you ever rush past God’s obvious blessings without acknowledging His intervention and provision? Sometimes we recognize God’s hand through evident success. Other times, God’s blessing comes through His unrelenting presence through persistent hardship. In every case, God upholds His purposes in the lives of His people. In what situation do you need God to act on your behalf? How will you trust God to do what only He can? How will you look for God’s hand at work in your life?
