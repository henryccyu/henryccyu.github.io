# 利未记中的福音

### 核心主题：利未记中的基督与福音

每一种祭祀都指向耶稣基督拯救我们的某个方面。耶稣处理我们的罪疚感，支付我们的赎价，并修复我们与神的关系。耶稣是终极的祭物，通过一次献祭，使我们的罪永远得到赦免。

### 利未记在圣经叙事中的地位

利未记展示了圣洁是绝对的要求。虽然上帝是恩典的神，但这并不意味着我们可以随意生活。利未记在某种程度上是《出埃及记》结尾的延伸，描述了以色列人如何从一个家族转变为一个拥有特定崇拜方式的民族，并预示了基督的救恩。

### 理解“圣洁”的真正含义

希伯来语中的“圣洁”字面意思是“分别出来”。圣洁不仅是道德上的，甚至是帐幕里的器皿也可以被称为“圣洁”，因为它们是被专门留给上帝使用的。圣洁不仅仅是遵守规则，而是将整个生命奉献给上帝，不为自己或他人，而是单单为神。

### 律法与恩典的关系

当你读利未记时，你会意识到没有人能完美遵守这些律法。这说明了“世人都犯了罪”，从而引向我们需要恩典。

### 基督在利未记中的三种角色

* **作为祭物**：每一种献祭（如燔祭、赎罪祭）都对应耶稣拯救的不同侧面：处理罪疚、修复关系、支付债务。
* **作为大祭司**：耶稣是真正的祭司。他不仅是通往神的中间人，而且因为他曾成为人，所以他是一位满有怜悯和同情心的大祭司。
* **作为圣殿/帐幕**：耶稣本身就是我们与神相遇的地方。

### 基督教的“独特性”与“古怪”

凯勒分享了一个关于早期基督徒与异教邻居对话的故事：
邻居问：“你们的圣殿在哪里？”基督徒答：“我们没有，耶稣就是圣殿。”
邻居问：“你们的祭司在哪里？”基督徒答：“耶稣就是我们的祭司。”
邻居问：“在哪里献祭？”基督徒答：“耶稣就是祭物。”
结论是，基督教在某种意义上不像任何其他宗教。它不仅是一位教导我们如何找到神的老师，而是神亲自降临带我们走向祂。

Every single one of the the sacrifices points us to some aspect of how Jesus Christ saves us. Jesus deals with our guilt, Jesus pays our ransom and our debt, Jesus heals the relationships. So every one of the sacrifices points to an aspect of a wonderful salvation we have in Jesus. And of course Jesus being the ultimate sacrifice because it's the way all sins are forgiven forever; by one sacrifice our sins are forgiven forever.

Hi, this is a series discovering the gospel in every book of the Bible, and now we come to the Book of Leviticus. And there are many, many, many people who said, "I'm going to read right through the Bible," when they start in Genesis and never get past Leviticus because Leviticus is one of the strangest books of the Bible. What is it about? It's about holiness, and it's about, especially for us, it's a rather rather strange. It is about how God laid out the rules so that the Israelites could be holy and therefore they could worship and come into His presence.

Now what we're going to do each week—I mean, excuse me, each time we do this—is first I'll look and say: how does this book move the storyline of the Bible forward? Secondly, how does this book actually tell us something about the gospel principles of salvation by grace? And thirdly, how does it actually show us Jesus?

Let's talk about Leviticus first of all. The Book of Leviticus actually does move the storyline along. It partly does that by showing us that holiness was something absolutely required. That even though God was a God of grace and He overlooks our sin constantly and He forgives us for our sin constantly, that does not mean He says you can live any way you want. It moves the storyline along because it goes down into great detail on the temple and the Tabernacle—the excuse me, the Tabernacle—the priesthood, and the sacrifices, all of which are pointing forward to the salvation of Christ. And what this means, of course, is that the Book of Leviticus in some ways is an extension of the end of Exodus. And so they're moving from the state in which the children of God, the people of God, were just a family into being a nation-state and also having a prescribed worship that pointed forward to the salvation that Jesus Christ was going to give.

How does this actually though show us, if anything, gospel principles? I've had many people say, "Well, Leviticus is just rules and rules and rules, so many rules. How in the world does that actually show us grace? It seems like the most legalistic book anybody's ever read." And let's let's not miss the forest for the trees. One of the reasons why the rules are there—things you can't touch, things you can't eat, things you can't do, places you can't go—there was a practical aspect to this. And I'll just be very brief. Most Old Testament scholars say the practical aspect was for the Jews to stick with all the dietary laws and the clothing laws and all these laws that made them holy was a way of setting them apart from the other nations around them so that they were able to keep their culture and not become polluted with the idolatries around them.

And it's very important to see that the word "holy" does not just mean what you and I think tend to mean, which is very moral. No, literally the Hebrew word for holy means "set apart." And you won't understand the word holy unless you realize that pots and utensils in the Tabernacle could be called holy. You say, "How could they be holy? Because they're moral?" No, because they're set apart for the use of God. They're set apart, they are holy for God, they're dedicated to God. To be holy does mean, of course, a holy person is someone who's obeying the law of God, of course. But holiness is not just compliance to rules. Holiness is being wholly dedicated. It is being—is dedicating your life and doing everything not for you and not for other people, but for God Himself.

And the reason why there's all these laws around Israel that, by the way, Jesus Himself said this isn't true for Christian followers, they don't have to follow them today, was at that time in Redemptive history, at that time in the storyline of the Bible, it was critical for the Jews to stay separate so that they, again, were not syncretists. They didn't bring in all kinds of non-believing and pagan ideas into their culture.

The other way though, so on the one hand, you might say the holiness really, really shows a gospel principle, and that is that we're supposed to be dedicated to God, totally dedicated. The response to grace, getting out of Egypt, should be total dedication. But here's the other way in which I think the book of Leviticus actually speaks to the need for the gospel of grace: when you read through the Book of Leviticus, you immediately realize there's no way anybody can do all this. Nobody's going to be able to do this; it's too much. And it's in some ways Leviticus—it's a way for Leviticus to say what is said elsewhere in the Bible, which is there's no one without sin. There is no—no matter how hard you try, no one is without sin, and therefore you are going to need grace.

But here's the last thing to say when it comes to how Leviticus points us to Christ. It is not that difficult, especially if you read the Book of Hebrews. If you want to know how the gospel—I mean, how Jesus is seen in Leviticus—just go read Hebrews. Every one of the sacrifices points us to Jesus. There's the original, the burnt offering, which deals with our sin as guilt. There's the sin offering—if you read these very carefully, it deals with the fact that our sin just disrupts relationships. Every single one of the the sacrifices points us to some aspect of how Jesus Christ saves us. Jesus deals with our guilt, Jesus pays our ransom and our debt, Jesus heals the relationships. So every one of the sacrifices points to an aspect of a wonderful salvation we have in Jesus. And of course, Jesus being the ultimate sacrifice because it's the way all sins are forgiven forever; by one sacrifice our sins are forgiven forever.

Secondly, Jesus is the true priest because, on the one hand, he's the one who opens the way to God; he's the mediator. But it's also true that he's merciful and understanding because he's the God who became a human being. So he knows exactly how we feel and we can go to him like to a merciful, sympathetic high priest with our problems. Lastly, Jesus isn't just the ultimate sacrifice and the ultimate priest; he's actually the temple or Tabernacle itself, which was a place where you could meet God.

And let me end with an interesting story. Dick Lucas, who used to teach at Saint Helens Bishops Gate in London, right downtown London for many, many years, I once heard him do this story—I'm sure he got it from somebody else—but here's what he said. He said: imagine—we cannot imagine how weird Christianity was to the Greeks and Romans in the—to the early—the people who—the society in which the early church lived. We cannot really imagine just how weird Christianity was. And he said: imagine a Christian talking to a neighbor, and the neighbor realizes, "Oh, there's a pagan neighbor," says, "Oh, this guy is a Christian." And so the pagan neighbor says, trying to be friendly, he says, "Well, that's interesting you're a Christian. So, where's your temple? I—where—where are your Christian temples?" And the Christian says, "Well, we don't have any temples. Jesus is our temple. He's the way in which we relate to God." "Oh, no temples," says your neighbor. "Well then, where—where do your priests work?" And of course, the early Christian would have said, "Well, we don't have any priests. Jesus is our priest." "Whoa," says the neighbor. "That—what I said—well then, if you don't have any temple, you don't have any priests, where are the sacrifices offered?" And the Christian neighbor would say, "Well, we don't have any sacrifices. We don't do sacrifice because Jesus is our sacrifice." And the pagan neighbor would say, "What kind of religion is this?"

And Dick Lucas ends his story saying: there is a sense in which, of course, Christianity really isn't like any other kind of religion. It really isn't. Of course, it's a religion in one sense, but in another sense, it's so different than the other religions. It's—understanding of Jesus being the final temple, the final—he's not just a teacher who tells us how to get to God; he brings us to God. He's God come to bring—get us. And therefore, Leviticus points to the fact that we are weird. We are really weird. The—Leviticus is a very weird book; Christian—Christianity is a very weird faith, but it's wonderful.

So that's discovering the gospel in the Book of Leviticus. Thank you for being here and goodbye. Thank you.
